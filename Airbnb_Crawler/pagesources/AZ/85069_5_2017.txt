Some of our neighbors have owned here for many decades, and other younger families have recently purchased theirs from fix-and-flippers, who have nicely revamped portions our neighborhood for us during the 2008-2010 downturn.  We attend neighborhood meetings, and keep each other up to date on the Nextdoor app, which is essentially a social sharing site for neighborhoods...which brings all of our neighbors a little bit closer.  We know almost all of our nextdoor neighbors by name, and the average age here is probably 45 or 50 years old, so it's quiet during the night, with no college parties or obnoxious neighbors.

The apartment is about 2.5 blocks from the very last stop on the line (handy to know you cannot miss the stop!) on the light rail.  Kevin and Alisa were so welcoming and helpful.  The shared bathroom is just across from both rooms so very handy.  There's also a guest living room and separate guest fridge which is great.  I never cooked there but their kitchen is huge and well equipped.      The bedroom is super quiet and has everything you could need including all different types of pillows and tons of towels.    There's a huge shopping mall just 3 blocks away with a Target with a huge frozen and fresh produce (including organic) selection.  So the location really is handy.  There's a cinema round the corner there so for any night your're not energized to go out, that's a good option.    I was able to visit a lot of places downtown just using the light rail including the Phoenix Art Museum (great Warhol exhibition right now), Phoenix Public Market.  For further away, I'd recommend a car for a day or two.    Handy hints for future guests:  the Desert Botanical Garden is free the second Tuesday of every month (I happened to go that day by accident)  Phoenix Art Museum is free every Wednesday from 3pm to 9pm except any special exhibition (Warhol is worth the $8)    I also went to one of Kevin's recommendations for wine tastings, Postino's, also easily accessible from the light rail at Indian School Road stop.  Fantastic wine selection and good cheese board, friendly atmosphere for anyone to go solo or in a group.    Kevin was so helpful and responsive with suggestions on where to go and what to do.    I would definitely recommend a day trip to Sedona and Red Rock Canyon.  The drive is long and I'd recommend a tour than trying to do this yourself.  I couldn't find many tours leaving from Phoenix so I recommend DetoursAZ ((SENSITIVE CONTENTS HIDDEN) them).    For transportation without renting, sign up for Uber and Lyft.  With Lyft I was given 10 rides for $5 for the first 15 days; ideal if you are here on vacation.  Tip: get a car at least for half your time here. I booked with Enterprise on Camelback Road, about a mile away, but they still picked me up and rental was about $40 USD after everything was included.  If you are a US citizen (I am not), there’s something called Rapid Rides where you can rent privately owned cars and they can even deliver them.  Was not able to try out the service but for a modest compact car like  a Ford Focus, the daily rate was $28.    Great place overall - highly recommended!!!","reviewer_image_url":"https://a0.muscache.com/im/users/3521664/profile_pic/1347292061/original.jpg?aki_policy=x_medium","created_at":"2015-06-14T00:00:00Z"},{"reviewer_first_name":"Leti","comments":"I really enjoyed my visit to Phoenix.

I took away a star away because I was not aware that we would be sharing the place with two other airbnb rooms that all share a small hallway and a bathroom. Also, I was not aware that there would be no tv at all in the home. I can see that it wouldn't be good for the rooms to have any tv's because then it would be disturbing for the other guests that are sleeping just feet away from you. The central Phoenix location was great for us because we were traveling all over the area going to different spring training ballparks. One thing that was unsettling was the amount of bums lingering all over the streets right outside of the neighborhood, but I think that is because the house is so close to the bus/train stops. Overall we enjoyed the stay but if we come back to the Phoenix area again, we will choose something with a little more privacy.

(maybe even if you ARE a professional chef, lol).\n\nWe are only 2 blocks from the Montebello Light Rail station and bus depot, which will take you to/from the airport, downtown, the Convention Center, and ASU/ Tempe, so having a car is not at all necessary.  Here's an idea of all the fun places you will find along our Light Rail line: search: \"RailLife Phoenix\"\n\nWe're both major \"people people\".  Kevin works from the house, but is quiet, and allows you the freedom to come and go as you please, through your own entrance.  Alisa has a teenage son in Flagstaff, and splits her time between there and here. When we get the chance, we love to roam the planet (by Jeep or by plane, or via our 4x4 Overlanding (RV) vehicle we're building...). Even if we're out on the road traveling, we're always available for advice in person or by phone/text about great restaurants, directions, can't-miss attractions, etc.  \n\nCompared to a single-room hotel or motel room, not only is this bedroom and living room HUGE, with lots of room to spread out, but there's also some additional space for an air mattress we can set up if you need room for 3 total guests (additional cost for the third person).\n\nSheets, blankets, and pillows are all provided. Did I mention it is HUGE? Lots more space for you and your friends or family than a hotel room would have!\n\nWe are big believers in the \"Make Yourself At Home\" philosophy, and we want you to be comfortable! You are welcome to use anything in the house that you need. The kitchen and bathroom are fully stocked for you. You can even have us run a load of laundry for you for just $10/load washed and dried...enough to cover our costs and to fund the expensive washer repairs.\n\nIf you are coming to Phoenix to explore the city, a quick drive from our place will get you almost anywhere town and the 20 surrounding cities that make up the \"Valley Metro Area\". We are happy to help you plan your adventures if you would like suggestions. From white water rafting and golf lessons, to wine tastings and museums, (not to mention the GREAT diverse restaurant selection nearby!) we have found a lot of fun things to do in the Phoenix area!\n\nIf you are going to be traveling around the Southwest after your time in Phoenix, you can feel free to leave bigger bags here (locked away in a secure storage) and use our place as your home-base. San Diego, LA, Las Vegas, and the beaches of Rocky Point Mexico are all about 4-6 hours away. The Grand Canyon, Sedona, White Mountains, and AZ's wine country are 1-4 hours. Take your carry-on, and leave the big stuff here, while you explore!

Discrimination prevents hosts, guests, and their families from feeling included and welcomed, and we have no tolerance for it. Building an Airbnb where everyone can belong hinges on knowing that everyone in our community understands this mission and agrees to help us achieve it.&quot;,&quot;community_commitment.what_happens_to_my_future_reservations_if_I_decline?&quot;:&quot;What happens to my future reservations if I decline?&quot;,&quot;community_commitment.your_future_reservations_will_be_canceled_if_you_decline&quot;:&quot;Any future reservations will be canceled.&quot;,&quot;community_commitment.your_reservation_will_be_refunded_according_to_policy&quot;:&quot;Your reservation will be refunded according to the host’s cancellation policy.&quot;,&quot;shared.learn_more_sentence_link&quot;:&quot;%{link_start}Learn more%{link_end}.&quot;,&quot;community_commitment.future_reservations_will_be_canceled_with_guest_refunds&quot;:&quot;Any future reservations will be canceled and your guests will receive a full refund.&quot;,&quot;community_commitment.if_booked_as_a_guest_future_reservations_will_be_canceled&quot;:&quot;If you booked as a guest, any future reservations will be canceled.&quot;,&quot;community_commitment.what_if_laws_restrict_hosting_certain_guests?&quot;:&quot;What if laws in my area restrict me from hosting certain guests?&quot;,&quot;community_commitment.please_post_legal_restrictions_on_your_listing&quot;:&quot;Please post about the restriction on your listing, but be clear that it is a legal requirement in your area and that you are complying with local law.&quot;,&quot;community_commitment.what_if_i_have_safety_concerns_as_a_host?&quot;:&quot;As a host, what if I have safety concerns about accepting reservations from anyone?&quot;,&quot;community_commitment.if_you_host_shared_space_you_can_restrict_to_same_gender_guests&quot;:&quot;If you will share your living spaces with a guest, you may make a unit available only to guests of your own gender.&quot;,&quot;community_commitment.you_may_turn_down_guests_for_non_discriminatory_reasons&quot;:&quot;Under this policy, you may also turn down a guest for other reasons, just not on the basis of race, religion, national origin, ethnicity, sexual orientation, or age.&quot;,&quot;community_commitment.reflect_on_reasoning_to_avoid_bias_when_considering_requests&quot;:&quot;In general, when considering a booking request, reflect on your reasoning to ensure that bias isn’t a factor.&quot;,&quot;community_commitment.can_i_decline_reservations_requests_from_disabled_guests&quot;:&quot;Can I decline guests with disabilities if I don’t think my home is suitable for them?&quot;,&quot;community_commitment.tell_prospective_guests_about_your_listing_accessibility&quot;:&quot;In many cases, Airbnb hosts are not required to make their homes compliant with the standards set out in the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) .
