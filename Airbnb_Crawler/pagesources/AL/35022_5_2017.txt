The chefs cooked some amazing breakfasts for us - we were really happy with the food, especially the Lebanese breakfast! The house is beautiful with a really nice garden/backyard, and exactly as specified in the listing. Hot water was an issue on our first two nights, but this was fixed for our third when we informed Peter. The house is located in a safe area, but is a little difficult/ confusing to find on (SENSITIVE CONTENTS HIDDEN) Maps or relay to taxi drivers as it isn't near a well-known landmark and is in a suburb that is a bit of a distance away from the city center. The area is also not very well-lit at night. We found it tough to explore the nightlife in the city as a result, but it was also nice to hang out as a group (since we were 6) in the house since it was large enough and had comfortable and cozy furniture / a fireplace.","reviewer_image_url":"https://a0.muscache.com/im/users/2759174/profile_pic/1410756258/original.jpg?aki_policy=x_medium","created_at":"2016-09-01T00:00:00Z"},{"reviewer_first_name":"Andrew","comments":"Hands down, up there with the best accommodation experiences I've ever had.

From our initial ride in from the airport (arranged by hosts, Peter and Kelly), to the warm greeting we received upon our arrival, to the kind and accommodating staff, we could not have had a better experience and that was just the beginning.   Each day we were treated to great food, interesting people, and great conversation much of which took place by the fireplace or sitting out by the marvelous garden.  I will long remember the afternoon meal of zaatar, hummus and guacamole!  I can still taste it.  Kelly and Peter are extraordinary hosts and great people.  We can't say enough about our experience.

Ruth, Jane and Lucy made wonderful breakfasts, and helped ensure we were well looked after.    Hob house is beautiful and was very comfortable.

The Kitisuru suburb is a bit removed from Nairobi, but at the same time, seems very safe and has lots of expat amenities.

As a family of two adults, travelling from Canada with a 3 year old and 2 one year olds, we needed to find a place where our children would be able to play safely during the day.    The main feature and selling point is the HUGE garden planted with wonderful old trees, flowers and grass. There is a smaller private area near the bungalow and as well a massive grassy area beyond we can play soccer/football. There is also a BBQ outside and the host provides outdoor seating and a table if you are planning on having gatherings outside.     We brought our own cribs to accommodate the twins, but our host provided everything else we needed in terms of bedding. There were even two spare mattresses for the occasional guests. The kitchen is basic, with a small fridge, microwave, sink, countertop gas burner and pantry. If you do a lot of cooking and are used to an american size kitchen, you will find it a bit small. But our local househelp had no problem cooking up major feasts in it. The shower is an electric flow through which provides an adequate amount hot water for showers. The toilet is just fine and the washbasin is good. All the bathroom and kitchen facilities are rustic and what you would expect for a country cottage type accommodation.    The house is a wooden construction, so during the cold season, you need to bring extra fleecy sweaters to avoid getting chilly at night. The host can provide hot water bottles for the beds.    As my husband works near the UN complex the location was ideal, just a 12 minute drive away through the neighbourhood of Runda.     It is also just a 10 minute walk to a restaurant with attached playground, which was handy for our 3 year old.    The new superhighway, Thika Road, is a 3 minute drive, and connects you to the nightlife of Westlands in 15 minutes, and to the central business district in 15 minutes (at low traffic times). There is also a major mall with a modern Nakumatt supermarket about a 10 minute traffic free drive away, and many small local shops around the area. The mall also has a bouncy castle on the weekends for the kids.    About a 10 minute drive away, along Kiambu road there is the Karura Forest, an amazing and SAFE place to walk for hours and see monkeys, rivers and fragrant Eucalyptus trees. Also along the same road is Paradise lost, a wonderful nature park with horse riding, a playground, boat rides, caves and waterfalls.    In all we were so happy to have found this place and if you don't mind living simply, you will be rewarded with a garden paradise away from the hustle and bustle of dusty Nairobi.

The family members were really friendly with us, they made us feel as if we belong to Di Meglio family. They have two lovely dogs, which are very frindly with you and 5 little puppies as well.   We had the opportunity to rent a scooter, and travel all around the island also. This made us connect to most bancomats, and shopping places easily. We've been to many beaches to the island and also the termal places. The nights of Ischia is a bit cold. So please take a sweater and pair of panths with you.

It is very pleasant to stay in his house.","reviewer_image_url":"https://a0.muscache.com/im/users/2510155/profile_pic/1340120993/original.jpg?aki_policy=x_medium","created_at":"2012-08-15T00:00:00Z"},{"reviewer_first_name":"Hiroko","comments":"The most amazing location, rooms, food, and staff. I could not have asked for anymore. This villa is an ideal base for a Ischia Holiday.   My friend and I stayed for 6 nights. We enjoyed cooking with the fruits and vegetables from the bio garden, doing yoga exercise on the terrace every morning. We went to Maronti Beach, St Angelo, Baia di Sorgeto and Giardini Poseidon Terme, everywhere is easy to access from this apartment by bus and water taxi in the reasonable fare.   I feel the history of the antique villa constructed in 17-18 century though the rooms are renovated beautiful, modern and clean. I also feel this villa's site is so purified because there are many fireflies in the garden. Sometimes the fireflies came into the room ( I tried to take them outside, but it was (URL HIDDEN) was the first experience for me to fall asleep in the glow of the firefly.  GianLuigi and the staffs are so kind and helped me a lot. He presented me potatoes when I firstly hesitated to pick the vegetables in the garden. And he brought me some bottles of mineral water when I forgot to buy on the weekend (Off course I supplied the new mineral water to the refrigerator when I checked out). I found the oranges the gardener left for me on the outside table when I came back the villa so tired. Many thanks to GianLuigi and all staff.  It is very difficult to find any bad points of this villa. I strongly recommended all the people loving Ischia to stay here. And I am hoping that this place will never change.    最高の立地、部屋、食べ物、そしてスタッフ。私にはこれ以上望むことはありせんでした。このヴィラはイスキアでの休暇に理想的な拠点です。私と友人はここに6泊し、ビオの自家菜園で採れた野菜で料理を楽しみ、毎朝テラスでヨガをしました。マロンティ海岸やサンタンジェロ、ソルジェート湾、ポセイドン温泉公園に行きましたが、どこも手頃な運賃のバスと水上タクシーでアクセスしやすかったです。  部屋は美しく近代的にきれいに改装されていますが、17~18世紀に建てられたというこの古いヴィラの歴史を感じます。また、ここの敷地は浄化されているとも感じました。それは、庭にたくさんの蛍がいたからです。ときどき蛍は部屋の中に入ってきて(私は外に出そうとしましたが、難しかったです)、蛍の光の中で眠るのは初めての経験でした。  ジャンルイジさんとスタッフはとても親切で私をたくさん助けてくれました。最初、私が庭の野菜を採るのを遠慮していたら、彼はジャガイモをプレゼントしてくれました。私が週末にミネラル・ウォーターを買うのを忘れたときは、持ってきてくれました(もちろんチェックアウトの時に冷蔵庫に新しく補充しておきました)。疲れて帰ってきたら、外のテーブルに庭師の人が私のために置いていってくれたオレンジをみつけたこともありました。ジャンルイジさんとスタッフには感謝の気持ちで一杯です。  このヴィラについて悪い点をみつけることは難しいです。イスキアを愛するすべての人にここに滞在することを強くお勧めします。そして、この場所がいつまでも変わらないことを願っています。        ","reviewer_image_url":"https://a0.muscache.com/im/users/5963706/profile_pic/1374305946/original.jpg?aki_policy=x_medium","created_at":"2013-06-13T00:00:00Z"}],"space":"Gorgeous self-sufficient apartments, which are part of an antique regal villa.

The house is beautiful with a really nice garden/backyard, and exactly as specified in the listing. Hot water was an issue on our first two nights, but this was fixed for our third when we informed Peter. The house is located in a safe area, but is a little difficult/ confusing to find on (SENSITIVE CONTENTS HIDDEN) Maps or relay to taxi drivers as it isn't near a well-known landmark and is in a suburb that is a bit of a distance away from the city center. The area is also not very well-lit at night. We found it tough to explore the nightlife in the city as a result, but it was also nice to hang out as a group (since we were 6) in the house since it was large enough and had comfortable and cozy furniture / a fireplace.","reviewer_image_url":"https://a0.muscache.com/im/users/2759174/profile_pic/1410756258/original.jpg?aki_policy=x_medium","created_at":"2016-09-01T00:00:00Z"},{"reviewer_first_name":"Andrew","comments":"Hands down, up there with the best accommodation experiences I've ever had.

From our initial ride in from the airport (arranged by hosts, Peter and Kelly), to the warm greeting we received upon our arrival, to the kind and accommodating staff, we could not have had a better experience and that was just the beginning.   Each day we were treated to great food, interesting people, and great conversation much of which took place by the fireplace or sitting out by the marvelous garden.  I will long remember the afternoon meal of zaatar, hummus and guacamole!  I can still taste it.  Kelly and Peter are extraordinary hosts and great people.  We can't say enough about our experience.

Ruth, Jane and Lucy made wonderful breakfasts, and helped ensure we were well looked after.    Hob house is beautiful and was very comfortable.

The Kitisuru suburb is a bit removed from Nairobi, but at the same time, seems very safe and has lots of expat amenities.

As a family of two adults, travelling from Canada with a 3 year old and 2 one year olds, we needed to find a place where our children would be able to play safely during the day.    The main feature and selling point is the HUGE garden planted with wonderful old trees, flowers and grass. There is a smaller private area near the bungalow and as well a massive grassy area beyond we can play soccer/football. There is also a BBQ outside and the host provides outdoor seating and a table if you are planning on having gatherings outside.     We brought our own cribs to accommodate the twins, but our host provided everything else we needed in terms of bedding. There were even two spare mattresses for the occasional guests. The kitchen is basic, with a small fridge, microwave, sink, countertop gas burner and pantry. If you do a lot of cooking and are used to an american size kitchen, you will find it a bit small. But our local househelp had no problem cooking up major feasts in it. The shower is an electric flow through which provides an adequate amount hot water for showers. The toilet is just fine and the washbasin is good. All the bathroom and kitchen facilities are rustic and what you would expect for a country cottage type accommodation.    The house is a wooden construction, so during the cold season, you need to bring extra fleecy sweaters to avoid getting chilly at night. The host can provide hot water bottles for the beds.    As my husband works near the UN complex the location was ideal, just a 12 minute drive away through the neighbourhood of Runda.     It is also just a 10 minute walk to a restaurant with attached playground, which was handy for our 3 year old.    The new superhighway, Thika Road, is a 3 minute drive, and connects you to the nightlife of Westlands in 15 minutes, and to the central business district in 15 minutes (at low traffic times). There is also a major mall with a modern Nakumatt supermarket about a 10 minute traffic free drive away, and many small local shops around the area. The mall also has a bouncy castle on the weekends for the kids.    About a 10 minute drive away, along Kiambu road there is the Karura Forest, an amazing and SAFE place to walk for hours and see monkeys, rivers and fragrant Eucalyptus trees. Also along the same road is Paradise lost, a wonderful nature park with horse riding, a playground, boat rides, caves and waterfalls.    In all we were so happy to have found this place and if you don't mind living simply, you will be rewarded with a garden paradise away from the hustle and bustle of dusty Nairobi.

The family members were really friendly with us, they made us feel as if we belong to Di Meglio family. They have two lovely dogs, which are very frindly with you and 5 little puppies as well.   We had the opportunity to rent a scooter, and travel all around the island also. This made us connect to most bancomats, and shopping places easily. We've been to many beaches to the island and also the termal places. The nights of Ischia is a bit cold. So please take a sweater and pair of panths with you.

It is very pleasant to stay in his house.","reviewer_image_url":"https://a0.muscache.com/im/users/2510155/profile_pic/1340120993/original.jpg?aki_policy=x_medium","created_at":"2012-08-15T00:00:00Z"},{"reviewer_first_name":"Hiroko","comments":"The most amazing location, rooms, food, and staff. I could not have asked for anymore. This villa is an ideal base for a Ischia Holiday.   My friend and I stayed for 6 nights. We enjoyed cooking with the fruits and vegetables from the bio garden, doing yoga exercise on the terrace every morning. We went to Maronti Beach, St Angelo, Baia di Sorgeto and Giardini Poseidon Terme, everywhere is easy to access from this apartment by bus and water taxi in the reasonable fare.   I feel the history of the antique villa constructed in 17-18 century though the rooms are renovated beautiful, modern and clean. I also feel this villa's site is so purified because there are many fireflies in the garden. Sometimes the fireflies came into the room ( I tried to take them outside, but it was (URL HIDDEN) was the first experience for me to fall asleep in the glow of the firefly.  GianLuigi and the staffs are so kind and helped me a lot. He presented me potatoes when I firstly hesitated to pick the vegetables in the garden. And he brought me some bottles of mineral water when I forgot to buy on the weekend (Off course I supplied the new mineral water to the refrigerator when I checked out). I found the oranges the gardener left for me on the outside table when I came back the villa so tired. Many thanks to GianLuigi and all staff.  It is very difficult to find any bad points of this villa. I strongly recommended all the people loving Ischia to stay here. And I am hoping that this place will never change.    最高の立地、部屋、食べ物、そしてスタッフ。私にはこれ以上望むことはありせんでした。このヴィラはイスキアでの休暇に理想的な拠点です。私と友人はここに6泊し、ビオの自家菜園で採れた野菜で料理を楽しみ、毎朝テラスでヨガをしました。マロンティ海岸やサンタンジェロ、ソルジェート湾、ポセイドン温泉公園に行きましたが、どこも手頃な運賃のバスと水上タクシーでアクセスしやすかったです。  部屋は美しく近代的にきれいに改装されていますが、17~18世紀に建てられたというこの古いヴィラの歴史を感じます。また、ここの敷地は浄化されているとも感じました。それは、庭にたくさんの蛍がいたからです。ときどき蛍は部屋の中に入ってきて(私は外に出そうとしましたが、難しかったです)、蛍の光の中で眠るのは初めての経験でした。  ジャンルイジさんとスタッフはとても親切で私をたくさん助けてくれました。最初、私が庭の野菜を採るのを遠慮していたら、彼はジャガイモをプレゼントしてくれました。私が週末にミネラル・ウォーターを買うのを忘れたときは、持ってきてくれました(もちろんチェックアウトの時に冷蔵庫に新しく補充しておきました)。疲れて帰ってきたら、外のテーブルに庭師の人が私のために置いていってくれたオレンジをみつけたこともありました。ジャンルイジさんとスタッフには感謝の気持ちで一杯です。  このヴィラについて悪い点をみつけることは難しいです。イスキアを愛するすべての人にここに滞在することを強くお勧めします。そして、この場所がいつまでも変わらないことを願っています。        ","reviewer_image_url":"https://a0.muscache.com/im/users/5963706/profile_pic/1374305946/original.jpg?aki_policy=x_medium","created_at":"2013-06-13T00:00:00Z"}],"space":"Gorgeous self-sufficient apartments, which are part of an antique regal villa.

Ozan sent detailed instructions for finding the apartment before our arrival, and his friend Nejat met us and kindly ensured that we were set up for a great stay.    When I read other reviews for this listing, I was slightly concerned that we would have a difficult time traveling to the apartment, but it was very easy, and I would highly encourage you to stay here if you want to see places like Ephesus, Şirince, etc.  There is a minibus (#6) that will drop you off and pick you up from outside the apartment that heads to the Otogar in Kuşadası.  We never had to wait for more than five minutes to get the bus.  From the Otogar, you can make another bus connection to anywhere in the area.  It took approximately an hour to reach Ephesus, and it was certainly a welcome relief to return to the apartment at the end of a hot day and immediately jump in the water.

Small market and restaurant cafés are on the ground level of the building, large bazaar 5 min walk, and 2 supermarkets in shopping centers less than 5 min drive. Private off street parking was actually provided, unlike many places that advertise it but don't really have. Roads to historic sights in the area like Ephesus, Priene, and Milet were easy to find.     Every amenity needed provided for meals, 2 modern bathrooms, multiple AC's, and very comfortable, totally quiet sleeping accommodations. Large screen TV has multiple English language stations.     Also, should mention that Ozan was very easy to communicate with by phone and email and the address provided, using (SENSITIVE CONTENTS HIDDEN) Maps, put us right at the apartment.

It's not for everybody - It's not for someone that doesn't like the outdoors and wants to be pampered in a resort. There are plenty of those places, but this is quite unique and special. This is is for people that want to see and be close to all kinds of fabulous nature in a gorgeous and largely unspoiled area, where you might get fish for dinner from an indigenous fisherman paddling by.  You will get coconut water a minute after it was chopped from the tree. You'll see an amazing coral reef that's underneath your feet and your bed. I counted at least a half-dozen corals, a dozen invertebrates, and lots of different fishes.    All this with good internet ((SENSITIVE CONTENTS HIDDEN) video works well), good solar power and rainwater or bottled water. I used the Internet to keep up on some work things, learn about coral and the area, and to post pictures that made my friends want to join me.    The hosts, Dorene and Lazare, are friendly and helpful. I took the meals option, which I would recommend, especially for a short stay. As others mentioned, you should read the advice about preparations. By all means take precautions against bug bites. The rooms are well screened, but when you go out, especially morning or late afternoon, use your favorite bug protection method. I got complacent after a couple days and then they got me! But I would go back in a heartbeat and I miss it already. So maybe next year another visit!","reviewer_image_url":"https://a0.muscache.com/im/users/5123838/profile_pic/1361145256/original.jpg?aki_policy=x_medium","created_at":"2013-02-22T00:00:00Z"},{"reviewer_first_name":"Em","comments":"I organized a weekend trip for my grad school class, we were 31 people from 10+ nationalities and vastly different travel preferences.

Leading up to our arrival we had several contact moments with the caretakers who were more than helpful in providing any necessary special requests. Upon reaching Bocas del Toro, they were there waiting for us to take us to the lodge. Indescribably beautiful, with dolphins in front of the cabana's and algae lighting up the water at night, the entire stay was simply magical. Well treated for breakfast, lunch and dinner and with several well arranged trips, we had the time of our lives. I absolutely recommend staying here for either short or long term, either business or pleasure and for both single travellers and couples as well as groups.  If you're looking to be really out there, without other tourists bothering you, right in the middle of nature, but still with several conveniences as good food and Wifi (which worked really well!) the Topical Island Jungle Retreat is the place to be!","reviewer_image_url":"https://a0.muscache.com/im/users/27767375/profile_pic/1423995839/original.jpg?aki_policy=x_medium","created_at":"2015-09-24T00:00:00Z"},{"reviewer_first_name":"Dillon","comments":"Put simply, this property is paradise.

We stayed at all rooms, house and both cabins, and every room we stayed in was comfortable. For the seven days that we were there, it rained for three days and it was still beautiful! Don't worry about rainy season, it is still a magical place with lots of cover! When it was sunny, we saw lots of pretty coral, different kinds of fish, kayaked, snorkeled, SUP, went fishing(far from cabins), wake boarded (upon request) and went to Zapatillas(A MUST!) and it was all AWESOME! If you get a chance to hike, do it, it's so lush and beautiful with great views! Bring bug spray and sunscreen!   Lazare and Jody were the best hosts we could ever imagine. We instantly felt comfortable as soon as we met them. They were so accommodating, funny, GREAT COOKS, gave us privacy but were awesome company. Have them cook for you! Jody made this awesome garlic soup that I still think about until this day and Lazare with his tasty sauces and smoothies! Mmmm! You guys are the best!   We saw Dolphins almost every day so close to the dock! If you go to Panama, COME HERE!!! Thank you, Lazare and Jody, for making our honeymoon an unforgettable one!

A boat ride to and from the property is included in the fee. \n\nThe entire property is reserve-able when you book for 10 or more guests. We have a variety of cabins here to accommodate your large group. \n\nAlong the water front are 4 cabins and 1 house. \n\nThe Reef Cabin perched atop the island's coral reef, offers two private bedrooms , The Sunrise Room which has a king sized bed, and The Diving Board Room which has a queen size.  These Cabins sit above the Kitchen and the common space, where meal services are provided. On this deck there is also a fresh water shower (biodegradable soap only, please!) the composting toilet is a 2 minute walk, on the land. \n\nFor seperate bookings of the Reef Cabin Rooms only please see: https://www.airbnb.com/rooms/919910 \nor\nhttps://www.airbnb.com/rooms/1129768\n\nOn the water front as well we have a floating cabana with a queen sized bed and a king sized bed in the The Hidden Treasure Cabin, on stilts over the water. \n\nFor separate bookings of the Floating Cabana please see:\nhttps://www.airbnb.com/rooms/9372808\n\nFor separate bookings of the Hidden Treasure Cabin please see:\nhttps://www.airbnb.com/rooms/10702129\n\nThe house on the waterfront, the Dreamy Mangrove Treehouse, has 1 king sized bed and a convertable king sized couch in the livingroom. It has its own kitchen and composting toilet and an outdoor shower. \n\nFor separate bookings of the Dreamy Mangrove Treehouse please see:\nhttps://www.airbnb.com/rooms/15160244\n\nThe House up on the hill is made completely with lumber grown on site, and has a 180 degree view of the Tierra Oscura Lagoon.   It has a master bedroom with a king sized bed; a screened-in loft space with 3 queen sized beds, which can be converted into a yoga studio or meeting space, and  a basement dorm with 3 beds. This house has a septic system with a shower and 2 flushing toilets and a full kitchen.  \n\nClean linens and towels are provided for all guests. \n\nMeal services are offered on the dock, but spices, cooking oils, rice, and other kitchen basics are provided for your use, should you want to cook for yourselves, along with fresh young coconut juice, bananas, and other fresh goods from the property. (Cilantro, lemongrass, and citruses all grow around the Hill House!)\n\nTours are also available to neighboring beaches, rivers and towns, pricing varies by the number of guests.  Round trip boat ride will take you to the town of Bocas del Toro, or Old Bank on Bastimentos, which have many bars and restaurants, a fun backpacker party scene, some very good food, some not-so-good food, an airport, several small supermarkets, local fruit and vegetable stands, and lots of local color and diversity. A similar boat trip will take you to the mainland (Almirante), a jumping off point for extended trips to Panama's incredible cloud forest or Costa Rica. We also offer tours to neighboring beaches and National parks, Zapatillas islands, Red Frog Beach and Starfish Beach are the most famous. \n\nBring your bug spray, your hiking boots, and your bathing suit! It's tropical adventure time!\n\n\n!!! IMPORTANT: THIS IS A RUSTIC PLACE, NOT A RESORT !!!  \n\nIt's for the adventurous, who want reasonable comfort in a remote setting, and want to experience realities of rural life in the tropics. In addition to the abundant pleasures of the lush forests and reefs, you should expect to…..\n\nGO OFF GRID: You will run out of running water if you take long showers or if the rains don't come. The solar panels are backed by a generator, but you'll need to remember to turn off lights and fans when not in use — especially when the clouds hang out for a few days. \n\nWEAR BUG PROTECTION: We are bug conscious in the design of our accommodations.  You will see dozens of geckos feeding on the insects on the outside of the screens that keep you nice and relatively bug free in the house. That being said, a layer of coconut oil, or bug spray can keep you comfortable during \"Chitra Hour\" when the no-see-ums come out at dawn and dusk.

If you are looking for a perfect and quiet place to relax, view the sunsets and star gaze- you will never do better that this exceptionally gorgeous home.   Our hosts Kagan and Bilgiseven ( and their village friend E) were delightful , welcoming and kind people who were understandably proud of their lovely home. They could have not been more welcoming and considerate.   The house is gorgeous with awesome views. It is a fully equipped and comfortable home with all essentials ( and a few extras) provided.   The house is so remote and high up we felt we were on top of the world, looking out on views we will never forget.   A jeep is essential to cope with the off road bumpy track- which was a nature watch experience every time!

Much of the house very open, so expect to see some pretty wild lizards, preying mantis, and spiders on the ceiling and do not leave any food out, as the ring tailed lemur will get it (we lost some bananas our first night and learned our lesson).

The pictures do not lie. This place is absolutely amazing. Nestled atop a hill overlooking the arroyo and the east cape waters. We only had 4 days to explore the area around Los Barriles and we made good use of every minute that we did not spend simply relaxing at the house and taking in the views. Star gazing from the roof at night was spectacular. We traveled about an hour north to a nice snorkling spot and were treated to a show of whales jumping and slapping. The beach right in town is beautiful, clean and wide...just a bit rocky at the entrance. The pool at the house is perfect for lounging and dipping to cool off. We took our jeep down the arroyo and found an oasis. There had not been rain in quite a while, so the waterfall was all but dried up; however, it was beautiful to see a grove of palms in the middle of the desert canyon.   One of us had an important business project to complete and submit and the wifi was more than sufficient.  We spent a day in Los Cabos after dropping some friends off at the airport and were certainly glad we decided to stay away from the hubbub and flood of tourists. There are farmer's markets that offer organic produce and eggs. Do not expect low prices for food though. Although the town is peaceful and slow, even the supermarket had resort prices for groceries. We encountered a bit of excitement from a midnight visitor interested in our bounty....a ring-tailed cat made off with a loaf of bread and some bananas from an open window in the kitchen. We all had a good laugh about it and continued to enjoy breezes from the screened windows from then on.  I would recommend a visit to Blue Wave for organic goods and sundries or just to meet the pleasant proprietor.   Our stay was a dream and we will definitely make every effort to return.

Staying on the hill means you escape the wind from the beach ( it's a kiteboarding, fly fishing and mountain biking mecca for a reason ! ) for the warmth and quiet of the desert . You will be a 5 minute dune buggy ride to the water's edge or to town. . \r\n\r\nThe home is furnished with funky collection of mid - century furniture and it combines beautifully with a modern kitchen and the unpredictable floor plan to create many really comfortable places to hang out in . Your vista is always filled with expansive combinations of skies , mountains and the ocean . The entire acreage around the home is private and yours to explore . \r\n\r\nLos Barriles is a baja boom town with its ranchero soul intact. Local ranch owner families have embraced the American and Canadian families who call Los Barriles home from October to May. In June fishing is the focus of the town as the Sea of Cortez warms up and attracts really big fish.\r\n\r\nLos Barriles is a fine place to base from: you are less than a few hours safe drive north or south from epic adventures. It is an easy 50 minute drive from SJD airport. (Car rental or van service ($85) in the terminal)\r\n\r\nSide trips:\r\n\r\nNorth: Kayaking and camping on the islands off La Paz\r\nWest: Authentic Mexico meets California Surf Town at Todos Santos\r\nSouth: San Jose del Cabo - Saturday organic market at the Polo Grounds and dinner at Palmilla - and a hundred other great ways to spend the day.\r\nSouth: Cabo - Vegas as a marina. Loads of fun but you need to be drinking tequila to get it. \r\n\r\nEssentials: \r\nGood grocery stores - local organic easy to find. \r\nEasy to eat well every night at a different restaurant or taco stand. \r\nAmerican-style sports bar with a good plasma setup. \r\nEasy to meet fellow travelers and end up at a party dancing or jamming. \r\nTwo official ATMs, UPS office and a friendly on-the-ball Police department. \r\nOpen WIFI hookups everywhere.\r\nMiles and miles of open public, mainly deserted, beach. \r\nThe Sea of Cortez is so incredible you will smile when you swim in it. \r\n\r\nAsk a local rancher for just about anything and they will get it for you. Ranch cheese, raw milk, avocados, mangos, papayas, limes, carne, live chickens, horseback guide into the mountains - anything. Look for a white dusty rancher sombrero and/or sandals made of cowhide and tire tread. \r\n\r\n\r\n","summary":""},"pricing_quote":{"can_instant_book":false,"monthly_price_factor":0.58,"price":{"total":{"amount":4040,"amount_formatted":"$4040","is_micros_accuracy":null,"currency":"USD"}},"rate":{"amount":4040,"amount_formatted":"$4040","is_micros_accuracy":null,"currency":"USD"},"rate_type":"monthly","rate_with_service_fee":{"amount":4040,"amount_formatted":"$4040","is_micros_accuracy":null,"currency":"USD"},"weekly_price_factor":0.78},"recommendation_reason":null},{"listing":{"beds":6,"extra_host_languages":[],"id":1267169,"is_business_travel_ready":false,"is_family_preferred":false,"is_new_listing":false,"is_superhost":false,"lat":43.3653647951046,"lng":13.68256386746063,"localized_city":"Potenza Picena","name":"Villa al mare, immersa nel verde","person_capacity":6,"picture_count":24,"picture_urls":["https://a0.muscache.com/im/pictures/19095777/03b2b1d9_original.jpg?aki_policy=large","https://a0.muscache.com/im/pictures/19097866/29039cb9_original.jpg?aki_policy=large","https://a0.muscache.com/im/pictures/19098001/d96d57b5_original.jpg?aki_policy=large","https://a0.muscache.com/im/pictures/19098042/afc82f40_original.jpg?aki_policy=large","https://a0.muscache.com/im/pictures/19098076/351fb7c3_original.jpg?aki_policy=large","https://a0.muscache.com/im/pictures/20774411/f5f65536_original.jpg?aki_policy=large","https://a0.muscache.com/im/pictures/20774518/0813aab2_original.jpg?aki_policy=large","https://a0.muscache.com/im/pictures/20774549/060e76ce_original.jpg?aki_policy=large","https://a0.muscache.com/im/pictures/20774814/803ecb5f_original.jpg?aki_policy=large","https://a0.muscache.com/im/pictures/30439573/a3ed9538_original.jpg?aki_policy=large","https://a0.muscache.com/im/pictures/30742799/eb32831e_original.jpg?aki_policy=large","https://a0.muscache.com/im/pictures/31466029/4fabac7f_original.jpg?aki_policy=large","https://a0.muscache.com/im/pictures/31466703/76308dec_original.jpg?aki_policy=large","https://a0.muscache.com/im/pictures/31467354/98b60645_original.jpg?aki_policy=large","https://a0.muscache.com/im/pictures/32563888/aabd4f21_original.jpg?aki_policy=large","https://a0.muscache.com/im/pictures/55617488/ee004aa5_original.jpg?aki_policy=large","https://a0.muscache.com/im/pictures/55618028/c928d1c7_original.jpg?aki_policy=large","https://a0.muscache.com/im/pictures/55617860/57d7a6ee_original.jpg?aki_policy=large","https://a0.muscache.com/im/pictures/55618092/16e99d5b_original.jpg?aki_policy=large","https://a0.muscache.com/im/pictures/55618746/1808e719_original.jpg?aki_policy=large","https://a0.muscache.com/im/pictures/59705205/2d500eb0_original.jpg?aki_policy=large","https://a0.muscache.com/im/pictures/87f79537-a2e3-4d93-bc96-3540816ae01f.jpg?aki_policy=large","https://a0.muscache.com/im/pictures/673b91de-d755-41fd-98b4-0b40c03017bd.jpg?aki_policy=large","https://a0.muscache.com/im/pictures/0a748279-0e99-4189-9f85-1e9dbfc261a1.jpg?aki_policy=large"],"reviews_count":37,"room_type":"Entire home/apt","star_rating":5.0,"neighborhood_overview":"","picture_url":"https://a0.muscache.com/im/pictures/19095777/03b2b1d9_original.jpg?aki_policy=large","property_type":"Apartment","public_address":"Potenza Picena, Marche, Italy","seo_reviews":[{"reviewer_first_name":"Claudio","comments":"Our stay at Riccardo's was wonderful.

The Apartment was just as described. It was impeccably clean and a beautiful home. The apartment was very well kept up and everything worked as it should. One of the bedrooms has a balcony with a place to sit. We used the kitchen one night to have a quick meal and were able to find everything we needed. For our two night stay we paid for the breakfast each morning. This was absolutely worth it, as it was two of the most memorable breakfasts we have ever had (arrive hungry and with your cameras!). Fresh homemade jams, breads then hams, chorizo cheese, yogurt and granola, juice, coffee, olives, peppers, special Hungarian cheese spreads and I know I am forgetting a few other things. Day two was the same but with a frittata and an English berry bread pudding too. The location is outside of the town - about a 5-10 minute taxi ride. We came by train to Balatonalmádi and we managed by taxi to get to town and back as needed. The lake is close by and we swam at a nearby camping “Yacht Club” site both evenings (15 minute walk from house). The kids loved it. There is also a restaurant a 5 minute walk from the house. 7 minute walk away is a nice place to run along a lake bike path.  We also enjoyed taking a bus to Veszprém, eating at a cool local restaurant and walking up to the castle area where the views are as outstanding as Budapest, but without the crowds. I highly recommend this home and location to anyone of all ages. We hope to return here when we come back to Balatonalmádi!

He was always available via (SENSITIVE CONTENTS HIDDEN) for our questions and guidance. The most amazing part is not the place, but the trust that Mehmet has to his guest.
