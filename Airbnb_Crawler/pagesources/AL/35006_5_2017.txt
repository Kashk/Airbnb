She was there to meet us.  The house was great for what we needed.  The space for a family of 6 was great for us.  The master bathroom 2nd shower head was not working and we had an issue with the power going out in a portion of the house.  We contacted Melody immediately and she was willing to send an electrician out immediately.  We found that having the lights on and using the microwave seemed to turn off the power.  If you stay on a Tuesday be aware that the landscapers are there.  Caught us off guard to open the garage and they were there and asked to use the garage to get to the backyard.  Let me feeling uneasy with out stuff in the house. I called Melody immediately and she confirmed that yes they were there on Tuesdays.  Only thing I would recommend is adding thick memory foams on the bed.  The master bed was too firm for us but we dealt with it.  The second main room with the full/queen bed was okay.  However the pseudo 3rd room with a mattress on the floor was the worst and hardest one - it was commented that sleeping on the carpet may have been a better nights sleep.  The long ottoman twin bed next to the floor mattress had a topper so it was not as hard.  It worked for my 9 year old but was odd that it was not a true twin mattress bed.  Again all in all I would stay again if the bed accommodations was addressed.  The location was perfect and the neighborhood was great.  Loved it and would return!

The house was very clean and well-stocked.  We did a fair amount of cooking and the house has a great kitchen with more than we needed in terms of cookware, utensils, spices, etc.  We spent most of our time at the beach, but when we were at the house, most of our time was spent outside as the house has a large lovely back yard with lots of seating and a great view.   The bedrooms are a nice size and provided a lot of privacy for everyone, and we all woke up after the first night commenting on how comfortable the beds were.      We never met Dee Anna, but she was incredibly responsive and very proactive in getting information on how to access the home (very easy!) and following up to make sure that everything was okay.  She was hands-off, which we loved, but made it clear she was readily available if needed.      The house is in a nice location in a quiet neighborhood with lots of amenities around, but it’s more suburban than “beachie” and a car is really needed.  For those who are looking for a “beach house”, the walk from the house to the beach is not easy, but the drive to Salt Creek Beach, which we loved, was easy and had (inexpensive) parking and a trolley stop right there for free trips to other beaches along the PCH.     I would recommend this house to others.

Lots of personality.  Only feedback is that it's light and bright in the bedrooms in the am as there's no blinds, only a sheer curtain.  Beds comfy and nice linens.  Patio has a tiny peek of the ocean and outdoor patio is nice for enjoying cool ocean breezes and sitting outside.  Short walk to beach trail and beach. Little steep coming back uphill.  All beach and house necessities.  Wireless and tv worked well.  Owners are very accommodating.  Price we paid $253 per night was well worth the stay.

It was in a great location about 10 minutes walk from shops, the beach and a great little playground. San Clemente is a lovely city. It was quiet enough to give us a good break but there was still lots to do downtown, at the pier and at the beach.      The apartment had views of the water and caught a good breeze in the evenings. The kitchen was very well equipped, there were games and even a table tennis table in the garage. Our daughter loved the wagon and beach toys.","reviewer_image_url":"https://a0.muscache.com/im/users/7078711/profile_pic/1372048688/original.jpg?aki_policy=x_medium","created_at":"2014-07-22T00:00:00Z"}],"space":"This property is charming, Recently refurnished (7/1/13) with hotel quality beds and linens, 55\" smart t.v., dvd, queen sleeper sofa., wifi, ipod/iphone holder for your music...4 minute walk to the beach and trail.
