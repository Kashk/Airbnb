Rose's home is full of living plants and herbs, which she tends to and uses for all kinds of medicinal purposes (for instances, at first sign of my springtime allergies, Rose whipped me up a couple different solutions that honest to goodness made the sneezing stop within a day). Rose lives with a truly open heart. My conversations with her, usually had over a yummy organic dinner that she made from scratch, were always intellectually fascinating and spiritually satisfying. She has an awesome sense of humor, and her number one priority is the comfort and happiness of those staying under her roof. Rose really help me get my feet set in Little Rock, inviting me to cultural outings and introducing me to her wonderfully eclectic group of friends here. She even showed me how to change the spark plugs of my car, saving me a couple hundred bucks in the process! I could go on and on.

She was incredibly responsive and helpful throughout the entire trip, from booking to check out and everything in between! My friend and I were in town for doctoral interviews, not getting in until late, and she made arrangements for us to do so. She also let us leave our stuff and come back and pick it up after the interviews, which was extremely helpful! Thanks Rose! The only things I would mention is the outlet in the bathroom was broken and since we were two girls getting ready for an interview, doing our hair without a mirror was a little bit difficult. Additionally, we did not see a microwave, so if you are looking to stay for a while and may need to reheat food, I would ask about this. Finally, the in-room gas heater can be a bit loud as it heats up and cools down throughout the night; so if you're a light sleeper just consider this. Nonetheless, the place was cozy, clean, there is a desk and a closet, and it's really close to a number of restaraunts and destinations in Little Rock. Rose is absolutely fantastic, and I would recommend her place as an incredibly affordable and reasonable option for anyone needing a place to stay!","reviewer_image_url":"https://a0.muscache.com/im/users/9442520/profile_pic/1381853803/original.jpg?aki_policy=x_medium","created_at":"2016-12-02T00:00:00Z"},{"reviewer_first_name":"Drew","comments":"Rose was so helpful and communicative in arranging my arrival.

Asween was a very nice and welcoming host. Although the original arrangements made were a bit confusing as they did not include the apartment number, when I arrived she quickly came all the way from work to let me in. She was away for most of my stay there, and I only got to know her briefly on the first and last days.    Her apartment is located in the middle of an upscale and green neighborhood in Western Little Rock. The apartment complex itself is decent - they do have two pools which are quite nice. There are a couple of restaurants and bars as well as a supermarket in walking distance - anywhere else you would have to drive or take the bus. Bus stops that link to the city center are located directly around the corner (although beware - they don't run Sundays).    The room was sizable and I would think commendable for a short stay, although very minimally furnished with just a (albeit comfy) bed and no A/C. On the upside, there was ample storage space and a private bathroom.

The air conditioned sun room was very comfortable and a great place to sit and have your morning coffee or evening cocktail. The bathrooms were all well equipped. The home is impeccably maintained and truly felt like home. The garden area was in full bloom adding to the beauty of the property. Hot Springs Village is a 26,000 acre gated community (not a typo). Guests can only use two gates, West and East and they are 15 miles apart. West open 24 hrs and East closes at midnight. Do not pay attention to GPS to get to the community as it will take you to one of many owner only gates. Make sure you search for the West or East Gate on Desoto Dr and enter there only!  Also exiting the owners gate is also by card only so you either tailgate someone or use the two manned gates. It takes a bit getting use to coming and going but the home is worth the hassle of admission!!!","reviewer_image_url":"https://a0.muscache.com/im/pictures/688783fb-d3ef-4417-8744-f84be8551782.jpg?aki_policy=x_medium","created_at":"2016-06-20T00:00:00Z"},{"reviewer_first_name":"Sara","comments":"Betty was readily accessible for communication via airbnb.

Once your account is canceled, future booked trips will be canceled. You will still be able to browse Airbnb but you won’t be able to book any reservations or host any guests.&quot;,&quot;community_commitment.faq.how_can_i_give_my_feedback_or_get_more_info_about_this?&quot;:&quot;How can I share feedback about the commitment or get more information?&quot;,&quot;community_commitment.view_help_page_to_find_more_discrimination_faqs&quot;:&quot;You can also review our %{link_start}host resources%{link_end}, which cover frequently asked questions by hosts about Airbnb’s Nondiscrimination Policy.&quot;,&quot;community_commitment.cancel_your_account?&quot;:&quot;Cancel your account?&quot;,&quot;community_commitment.cancel_signing_up_on_airbnb?&quot;:&quot;Cancel signup?&quot;,&quot;community_commitment.declining_the_commitment_cancels_your_account&quot;:&quot;Declining this commitment means that your Airbnb account will be canceled, and your future reservations will be canceled.&quot;,&quot;community_commitment.declining_the_commitment_means_you_will_not_have_an_account&quot;:&quot;Declining this commitment means that you won’t have an Airbnb account, though you can still browse the site.&quot;,&quot;community_commitment.why_did_airbnb_create_this_commitment?&quot;:&quot;Why did Airbnb create this commitment?&quot;,&quot;community_commitment.important_step_toward_creating_a_global_community&quot;:&quot;This commitment is an important step towards creating a global community where everyone can truly belong. Discrimination prevents hosts, guests, and their families from feeling included and welcomed, and we have no tolerance for it. Building an Airbnb where everyone can belong hinges on knowing that everyone in our community understands this mission and agrees to help us achieve it.&quot;,&quot;community_commitment.what_happens_to_my_future_reservations_if_I_decline?&quot;:&quot;What happens to my future reservations if I decline?&quot;,&quot;community_commitment.your_future_reservations_will_be_canceled_if_you_decline&quot;:&quot;Any future reservations will be canceled.&quot;,&quot;community_commitment.your_reservation_will_be_refunded_according_to_policy&quot;:&quot;Your reservation will be refunded according to the host’s cancellation policy.&quot;,&quot;shared.learn_more_sentence_link&quot;:&quot;%{link_start}Learn more%{link_end}.&quot;,&quot;community_commitment.future_reservations_will_be_canceled_with_guest_refunds&quot;:&quot;Any future reservations will be canceled and your guests will receive a full refund.&quot;,&quot;community_commitment.if_booked_as_a_guest_future_reservations_will_be_canceled&quot;:&quot;If you booked as a guest, any future reservations will be canceled.&quot;,&quot;community_commitment.what_if_laws_restrict_hosting_certain_guests?&quot;:&quot;What if laws in my area restrict me from hosting certain guests?&quot;,&quot;community_commitment.please_post_legal_restrictions_on_your_listing&quot;:&quot;Please post about the restriction on your listing, but be clear that it is a legal requirement in your area and that you are complying with local law.&quot;,&quot;community_commitment.what_if_i_have_safety_concerns_as_a_host?&quot;:&quot;As a host, what if I have safety concerns about accepting reservations from anyone?&quot;,&quot;community_commitment.if_you_host_shared_space_you_can_restrict_to_same_gender_guests&quot;:&quot;If you will share your living spaces with a guest, you may make a unit available only to guests of your own gender.&quot;,&quot;community_commitment.you_may_turn_down_guests_for_non_discriminatory_reasons&quot;:&quot;Under this policy, you may also turn down a guest for other reasons, just not on the basis of race, religion, national origin, ethnicity, sexual orientation, or age.&quot;,&quot;community_commitment.reflect_on_reasoning_to_avoid_bias_when_considering_requests&quot;:&quot;In general, when considering a booking request, reflect on your reasoning to ensure that bias isn’t a factor.&quot;,&quot;community_commitment.can_i_decline_reservations_requests_from_disabled_guests&quot;:&quot;Can I decline guests with disabilities if I don’t think my home is suitable for them?&quot;,&quot;community_commitment.tell_prospective_guests_about_your_listing_accessibility&quot;:&quot;In many cases, Airbnb hosts are not required to make their homes compliant with the standards set out in the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) . However, you can’t decline a guest based on any actual or perceived disability. You should do your best to provide accurate information about your home’s accessibility features (or lack of them), allowing for guests with disabilities to decide for themselves whether the home is appropriate to their individual needs.&quot;,&quot;community_commitment.what_if_i_change_my_mind_after_declining_the_commitment?&quot;:&quot;What if I change my mind after declining?&quot;,&quot;community_commitment.we_will_send_you_info_about_how_to_reinstate_your_account&quot;:&quot;Once your account has been canceled, we’ll send you information about how to reinstate it if you change your mind.
