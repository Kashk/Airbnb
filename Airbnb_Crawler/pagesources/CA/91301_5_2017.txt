The house a prime location to the Calabasas Commons shopping center. A fifteen minute walk or 2 minutes by car to the Commons.

Once your account is canceled, future booked trips will be canceled.

Discrimination prevents hosts, guests, and their families from feeling included and welcomed, and we have no tolerance for it. Building an Airbnb where everyone can belong hinges on knowing that everyone in our community understands this mission and agrees to help us achieve it.&quot;,&quot;community_commitment.what_happens_to_my_future_reservations_if_I_decline?&quot;:&quot;What happens to my future reservations if I decline?&quot;,&quot;community_commitment.your_future_reservations_will_be_canceled_if_you_decline&quot;:&quot;Any future reservations will be canceled.&quot;,&quot;community_commitment.your_reservation_will_be_refunded_according_to_policy&quot;:&quot;Your reservation will be refunded according to the host’s cancellation policy.&quot;,&quot;shared.learn_more_sentence_link&quot;:&quot;%{link_start}Learn more%{link_end}.&quot;,&quot;community_commitment.future_reservations_will_be_canceled_with_guest_refunds&quot;:&quot;Any future reservations will be canceled and your guests will receive a full refund.&quot;,&quot;community_commitment.if_booked_as_a_guest_future_reservations_will_be_canceled&quot;:&quot;If you booked as a guest, any future reservations will be canceled.&quot;,&quot;community_commitment.what_if_laws_restrict_hosting_certain_guests?&quot;:&quot;What if laws in my area restrict me from hosting certain guests?&quot;,&quot;community_commitment.please_post_legal_restrictions_on_your_listing&quot;:&quot;Please post about the restriction on your listing, but be clear that it is a legal requirement in your area and that you are complying with local law.&quot;,&quot;community_commitment.what_if_i_have_safety_concerns_as_a_host?&quot;:&quot;As a host, what if I have safety concerns about accepting reservations from anyone?&quot;,&quot;community_commitment.if_you_host_shared_space_you_can_restrict_to_same_gender_guests&quot;:&quot;If you will share your living spaces with a guest, you may make a unit available only to guests of your own gender.&quot;,&quot;community_commitment.you_may_turn_down_guests_for_non_discriminatory_reasons&quot;:&quot;Under this policy, you may also turn down a guest for other reasons, just not on the basis of race, religion, national origin, ethnicity, sexual orientation, or age.&quot;,&quot;community_commitment.reflect_on_reasoning_to_avoid_bias_when_considering_requests&quot;:&quot;In general, when considering a booking request, reflect on your reasoning to ensure that bias isn’t a factor.&quot;,&quot;community_commitment.can_i_decline_reservations_requests_from_disabled_guests&quot;:&quot;Can I decline guests with disabilities if I don’t think my home is suitable for them?&quot;,&quot;community_commitment.tell_prospective_guests_about_your_listing_accessibility&quot;:&quot;In many cases, Airbnb hosts are not required to make their homes compliant with the standards set out in the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) .
