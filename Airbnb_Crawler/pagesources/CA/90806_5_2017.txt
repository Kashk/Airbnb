I couldn't have asked for more in a 1st Airbnb experience.  The cozy room had a microwave, a Keurig coffeemaker, and mini-fridge, complete with drinks and snacks to welcome me.  A nice selection of books were also available to read.  Her guide included publications on places to go, things to do, and a Metro Tap card for my convenience, since she knew I was going to use public transit during my 6-day stay.      Karen's attention to detail also extended to the bedding.  Plenty of blankets, if I needed a little something extra.  The pillows were very \"Goldilocks and the Three Bears\"... one very soft; one big, fluffy and hard; and one just right in the middle(URL HIDDEN) The gorgeous bath was newly renovated and had all the little extras that a nice hotel have.    My favorite place was the back yard.  Her gardens are well maintained and it's clear she likes to entertain with plenty of seating and a lovely \"surprise garden.\"  It was a very pleasant place to eat breakfast, sip a drink, or just sit in the sun.       Karen was the consummate host, checking on my needs and interests in the 1st couple of days to make sure I would have a good stay.  When I asked for directions to the Metro, she gave me a ride.  When rain was expected, she texted that she'd left an umbrella outside my door.  She did a little research and suggested places I would enjoy in the area. Any question I had, she made herself available to answer by phone, if not in person.      My daughter, who's stayed in several greater LA Airbnb's told me it was the nicest she'd seen.  \"Mom, you scored!\" was her frequent refrain.

The room and bathroom had been recently renovated and were very comfortable for two people. The garden is absolutely beautiful and is a great place to relax in the day or evening.    We had a car and were usually able to find on-street parking in front of her house; if we came home late in the evening we would sometimes have to park a block or so away, which wasn't too bad.

They have a beautiful, zen backyard where you can kick back and enjoy the California sunshine - or relax in the shade under the cantilever umbrella.    Jose and Paul were very warm and welcoming. They were full of suggestions about what to do and where to go in Long Beach/Los Angeles. Jose is a great cook and even gave us the opportunity to enjoy some of his delicious creations.

I couldn't have asked for more in a 1st Airbnb experience.  The cozy room had a microwave, a Keurig coffeemaker, and mini-fridge, complete with drinks and snacks to welcome me.  A nice selection of books were also available to read.  Her guide included publications on places to go, things to do, and a Metro Tap card for my convenience, since she knew I was going to use public transit during my 6-day stay.      Karen's attention to detail also extended to the bedding.  Plenty of blankets, if I needed a little something extra.  The pillows were very \"Goldilocks and the Three Bears\"... one very soft; one big, fluffy and hard; and one just right in the middle(URL HIDDEN) The gorgeous bath was newly renovated and had all the little extras that a nice hotel have.    My favorite place was the back yard.  Her gardens are well maintained and it's clear she likes to entertain with plenty of seating and a lovely \"surprise garden.\"  It was a very pleasant place to eat breakfast, sip a drink, or just sit in the sun.       Karen was the consummate host, checking on my needs and interests in the 1st couple of days to make sure I would have a good stay.  When I asked for directions to the Metro, she gave me a ride.  When rain was expected, she texted that she'd left an umbrella outside my door.  She did a little research and suggested places I would enjoy in the area. Any question I had, she made herself available to answer by phone, if not in person.      My daughter, who's stayed in several greater LA Airbnb's told me it was the nicest she'd seen.  \"Mom, you scored!\" was her frequent refrain.

The room's private entrance is very convenient to access and made it feel like we had our own apartment, although with the benefits of local knowledge and recommendations that Karen was able to share during our visit.     The room and bathroom had been recently renovated and were very comfortable for two people. The garden is absolutely beautiful and is a great place to relax in the day or evening.    We had a car and were usually able to find on-street parking in front of her house; if we came home late in the evening we would sometimes have to park a block or so away, which wasn't too bad.    We would definitely stay at Karen's again.

They have a beautiful, zen backyard where you can kick back and enjoy the California sunshine - or relax in the shade under the cantilever umbrella.    Jose and Paul were very warm and welcoming. They were full of suggestions about what to do and where to go in Long Beach/Los Angeles. Jose is a great cook and even gave us the opportunity to enjoy some of his delicious creations.

There is a kayak available on the boat, and we used that and brought our own stand-up paddleboards and enjoyed cruising around the harbor in the mornings before the wind piped up.   It was fun being right on the harbor - though potential guests beware, the Long Beach Harbor is kind of a weird mix of heavy industry and pleasure boats and you begin to wonder if you've entered some type of Matrix time warp looking out at the cranes and huge container ships nearby.  4 of us staying on the boat was  too many, though there are beds for even more. Note that the double bed is pretty small for 2 people (common on boats), so it's best to plan on no more than 3 people, one on each bed. And, boats are no place for light sleepers so if you count yourself as one, don't plan on sleeping well here.    Check in with the host about bedding. Everyone, bring ear plugs - regular fridge, clock, water lapping, boats passing, train whistles from the port, and more noises on boats are plentiful. The beauty of lights reflecting on water can make up for those inconveniences.   Parking was easy when we got there late Friday night. Our host met us - kind of necessary since instructions are needed about the boat, and access in and out of the locked dock area is difficult. Do make sure to ask for an extra key to the dock gate.   As is duly noted, there is a small toilet on board, and regular bathrooms on land - normal for boat slips. You have to be flexible and comfortable with sharing facilities.    Host Xun was helpful and ready to please and all in all, we had a good adventure.

The sheets themselves were smelly, so much so that I found it difficult to fall asleep. The shower is ridiculously tiny and a bit dingy. The bedroom itself is claustrophobic. The pictures made it look bigger. There were no toiletries at all. Bummer. I paid for two nights and could only stand one there.

The space is listed as family friendly, but unless you are the parent to children who's volume level never exceeds a 4 and activity level never rises above book reading, this might not be the best place. There is quite literally no room to play in or immediately around the building, so just be mindful of that when booking with kids.
