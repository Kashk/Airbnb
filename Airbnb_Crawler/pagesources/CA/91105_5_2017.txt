On New Years Eve night he skillfully made us cocktails and supplied delicious appetizers for us to enjoy. Each morning he had a beautiful breakfast set-up complete with anything desired. He is a very interesting and fun person to be around, and my mom and I are counting down the days until we can return to sunny Pasadena!

As part of a four floor 1928 multi-million dollar gated estate the grounds on a clear day reveal a glimpse of the ocean in the distance. Within walking distance are hiking trails into the canyons. This Spanish Mediterranean estate was originally built by two women from Chicago in the roaring 20’s. The home is on the national register of historic places and is particularly noted for its rare collection of 1920‘s Batchelder tile.  Mr. Batchelder was a famous maker of art tiles and leader of the American Arts and Crafts Movement as well as founder of the Pasadena Playhouse. The hand-made tiles while typically only found sparingly used around fireplaces abound in the Great Room of the home with an entire floor made of this rare and unique tile.\n..::: As seen in the photos :::..  the home contains curiosities from around the globe. Visual delights are everywhere from a massive Indian “floating door” in the living room to Mughal empire inspired tapestry crafted of golden thread and semi-precious stones of Kashmiri origin. Ancient thrown pots from Israel sit atop intricately carved wooden columns surrounded by Brazilian antiques nestled within a 35 foot high cathedral ceiling. A 12th Century Cambodian Apsara the female spirit of the clouds and waters quietly bemuse our guests while Moroccan glow lanterns adorn Persian artifacts and antique tea pots on display. Have your morning tea or coffee outside on the veranda overlooking Los Angeles with a delightfully friendly but exotic Black Russian Terrier.

Furthermore, TJ himself was a remarkable host. His generosity surpasses many if not all hosts I've ever had of a home, regardless of the fact that we had never met him before! On New Years Eve night he skillfully made us cocktails and supplied delicious appetizers for us to enjoy. Each morning he had a beautiful breakfast set-up complete with anything desired. He is a very interesting and fun person to be around, and my mom and I are counting down the days until we can return to sunny Pasadena!    The room itself was fantastic with a very comfortable bed, personal heating unit, and great shower. This truly was one of the most beautiful houses I have ever seen, and it is placed in a wonderful neighborhood. Additionally, the view of all of Los Angeles and Pasadena is stunning!

As part of a four floor 1928 multi-million dollar gated estate the grounds on a clear day reveal a glimpse of the ocean in the distance. Within walking distance are hiking trails into the canyons. This Spanish Mediterranean estate was originally built by two women from Chicago in the roaring 20’s. The home is on the national register of historic places and is particularly noted for its rare collection of 1920‘s Batchelder tile.  Mr. Batchelder was a famous maker of art tiles and leader of the American Arts and Crafts Movement as well as founder of the Pasadena Playhouse. The hand-made tiles while typically only found sparingly used around fireplaces abound in the Great Room of the home with an entire floor made of this rare and unique tile.\n..::: As seen in the photos :::..  the home contains curiosities from around the globe. Visual delights are everywhere from a massive Indian “floating door” in the living room to Mughal empire inspired tapestry crafted of golden thread and semi-precious stones of Kashmiri origin. Ancient thrown pots from Israel sit atop intricately carved wooden columns surrounded by Brazilian antiques nestled within a 35 foot high cathedral ceiling. A 12th Century Cambodian Apsara the female spirit of the clouds and waters quietly bemuse our guests while Moroccan glow lanterns adorn Persian artifacts and antique tea pots on display. Have your morning tea or coffee outside on the veranda overlooking Los Angeles with a delightfully friendly but exotic Black Russian Terrier. This is a quiet serene place of reflection, rebirth and rejuvenation.","summary":"Your oasis is secluded at the end of a hardwood hallway with a Queen sized bed and views of the uninhabited rolling hills and canyons.

I lived here for 3 months during the summer. The room was very small and is on the first floor. The bathroom is near the kitchen and the shower is on the second floor. With no air conditioner, the heat in the room was extreme and unbearable during the day and sometimes even at night. I often saw ants in the house including my bedroom. Street parking was often difficult to find and the area didn’t feel safe for overnight parking. The hosts had several written rules to follow like no food in the bedroom, cleaning the dishes after use, and so on. They also had unwritten rules like maximum 10-minute shower and only 2 loads of laundry per week.     At the beginning, I felt the hosts were pleasant, but later on I felt differently. When I come back from work, I really prefer to relax and have quiet alone time. The male host wanted to have conversation with me and, at times, I felt that he was asking too many questions which kind of turned into long discussions. I really didn’t feel like talking to him at all, so I tried to avoid him at all cost, but since I have to eat in the kitchen area and pass through the common area for bathroom and shower, I constantly ran into him. I tried to avoid him even to a point of not greeting him in fear that he might want to carry on a conversation. He gave me a pep talk about me not saying hi, so we agreed to just greet each other and have no further discussion. That ended shortly after he broke the agreement by asking me more questions. I felt the hosts think that the guest has to socialize with them; I believe I am just renting a place to rest in privacy. I didn’t think it was necessary to have to be so social with people that I’m not particularly close with, over boundaries that I didn’t really wish to cross. I guess there is difference in opinion.      Two days before the end of my planned stay, which was fully paid for, my family came by to help me pack. The male host started to yell at me and my family about my behavior and not greeting him. Eventually, we apologized and ended the argument, but he continued and became more hostile and said a racially derogatory remark. My parents felt that it was not safe to leave their daughter here, so they decided to finish packing and leave the place right away. So I left two days before the scheduled leave.    The hosts should make the rules clear in advance and not make it up as you go. Overall, my experience was not what I expected, and I definitely would not use this place again.

By the time you reach the house, you'll have walked through a miniature jungle past multiple secluded seating areas, wild birds, a chicken coop, a flock of white pigeons, and you'll probably be followed by a friendly turkey and two overly enthusiastic dogs, and will finally find yourself high up in the hills with a great view of the surrounding neighborhood. The house itself is comfortable, you'll be sharing the lower level with a resident, but have a private bedroom and bathroom to yourself -- but the outdoor spaces are the biggest appeal of the place. Rene was very friendly and kind, and I wish I'd had more time to chat with him! He did tell me that the turkey had fought off a coyote the night before I got there, which is the coolest thing I've ever heard in my life. Anyway, my stay was lovely, I would definitely stay again in the future as it's a close walk or bike ride from the fun Highland Park neighborhood, and an incredibly unique space to relax. Finally, I should mention that the walk from the street level up to the house is long and steep -- nothing to worry about if you're in good health, but anyone with mobility issues would have trouble getting inside.","reviewer_image_url":"https://a0.muscache.com/im/users/7511803/profile_pic/1439227210/original.jpg?aki_policy=x_medium","created_at":"2017-02-12T00:00:00Z"},{"reviewer_first_name":"Joe","comments":"We felt welcomed, cared fore, and accommodated.

Discrimination prevents hosts, guests, and their families from feeling included and welcomed, and we have no tolerance for it. Building an Airbnb where everyone can belong hinges on knowing that everyone in our community understands this mission and agrees to help us achieve it.&quot;,&quot;community_commitment.what_happens_to_my_future_reservations_if_I_decline?&quot;:&quot;What happens to my future reservations if I decline?&quot;,&quot;community_commitment.your_future_reservations_will_be_canceled_if_you_decline&quot;:&quot;Any future reservations will be canceled.&quot;,&quot;community_commitment.your_reservation_will_be_refunded_according_to_policy&quot;:&quot;Your reservation will be refunded according to the host’s cancellation policy.&quot;,&quot;shared.learn_more_sentence_link&quot;:&quot;%{link_start}Learn more%{link_end}.&quot;,&quot;community_commitment.future_reservations_will_be_canceled_with_guest_refunds&quot;:&quot;Any future reservations will be canceled and your guests will receive a full refund.&quot;,&quot;community_commitment.if_booked_as_a_guest_future_reservations_will_be_canceled&quot;:&quot;If you booked as a guest, any future reservations will be canceled.&quot;,&quot;community_commitment.what_if_laws_restrict_hosting_certain_guests?&quot;:&quot;What if laws in my area restrict me from hosting certain guests?&quot;,&quot;community_commitment.please_post_legal_restrictions_on_your_listing&quot;:&quot;Please post about the restriction on your listing, but be clear that it is a legal requirement in your area and that you are complying with local law.&quot;,&quot;community_commitment.what_if_i_have_safety_concerns_as_a_host?&quot;:&quot;As a host, what if I have safety concerns about accepting reservations from anyone?&quot;,&quot;community_commitment.if_you_host_shared_space_you_can_restrict_to_same_gender_guests&quot;:&quot;If you will share your living spaces with a guest, you may make a unit available only to guests of your own gender.&quot;,&quot;community_commitment.you_may_turn_down_guests_for_non_discriminatory_reasons&quot;:&quot;Under this policy, you may also turn down a guest for other reasons, just not on the basis of race, religion, national origin, ethnicity, sexual orientation, or age.&quot;,&quot;community_commitment.reflect_on_reasoning_to_avoid_bias_when_considering_requests&quot;:&quot;In general, when considering a booking request, reflect on your reasoning to ensure that bias isn’t a factor.&quot;,&quot;community_commitment.can_i_decline_reservations_requests_from_disabled_guests&quot;:&quot;Can I decline guests with disabilities if I don’t think my home is suitable for them?&quot;,&quot;community_commitment.tell_prospective_guests_about_your_listing_accessibility&quot;:&quot;In many cases, Airbnb hosts are not required to make their homes compliant with the standards set out in the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) .
