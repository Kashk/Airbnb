The kitchen had a full size refrigerator which was nice if buying groceries. The apartment stays nice and cool with the window unit AC. The bathroom is a great size and water pressure/heat is wonderful. The queen size bed is really comfortable. The fan above the bed helps keep you nice and cool but has a mind of its own at times. The light would turn on and off on its own in the middle of the night, but I only noticed when staying up late in the evening. The elevator is right next to the apartment and you can hear it throughout the day. At night the elevator doesn't get used much so it's not bad. The parking situation isn't the best as it is really hard to find parking on the block anytime after 5pm. The nice part about the location is that it is close to a lot of things so you can either walk or uber to your destination without having to move your car and loose your parking spot. Other then that, Michael is a good host and responded quickly if I had any issues or questions.

I think this was because the property and living situation wasn’t accurately described on the Airbnb website.      This is a high activity/party house. There is a hookah lounge at the front of the house by the living room and the “private courtyard” is used by quite a few guests for drinking, smoking cigarettes/marijuana, music, hanging out etc. The private entrance into the bamboo room leads directly to this courtyard, so it can be noisy in the room.     The bamboo room is located at the back of the main house and is one of 6 rooms on the property. It shares the private courtyard with two other rentals, one that is semi-attached to the main house and the other is free-standing. All entries are within ~ 2 meters of each other, so fairly close together. These rentals were high occupancy, for example during my stay one of the units regularly had 5+ guests and there was also high turnover.     The main house has an additional 3 guest rooms. These rooms share a single bathroom that is located off of the same hallway with the second entrance into the bamboo room. These 3 rooms were also high occupancy and high turnover; during my stay individual rooms would have 3+ guests. This meant there was a lot of people traffic in the hallway with so many guests sharing the same bathroom.     I found the kitchen to be generally messy. There were always dirty dishes in the sink area and little room for food in the refrigerator. I was able to keep some milk and a few small items, but I was never able to cook due to lack of space, the general dearth of pots/pans, cooking utensils, and cleanliness problems.      Parking was also a logistic problem. I ended up getting blocked in by other cars several times and had to wait up to an hour to get out. The only way to resolve the problem was to notify Josh of my schedule the night before and give him access to my car keys so he could essentially valet cars around the property. Often my car was left on the street.    Personally, I didn’t want to live at a party house - there were parties every week, during the week, and on weekends. I felt that Josh expected guests to go along with whatever events were organized. Anytime I brought up concerns, I was treated like there was something wrong with me - I'm sensitive, stressed, etc... For example, one of the other longer term tenants would regularly practice playing drums (full size rock and roll drum set) and Josh told me I was sensitive/under stress (i.e., unreasonable) for not being ok with that. (My cat practically went bald the poor thing was so stressed). There was never any acknowledgement on Josh's side that the problem might be his misrepresentation of the property.     I was happy to leave.

No heating in the building during the 5 nights I stayed and it was really cold that week. Garth did provide us an electric heater but it only warmed up the little spot in front of the heater.

Garth was accessible and welcoming even with our late night arrival. The apartment was clean, but in an older building with the inherent eccentricities such as older plumbing and steam heat. The location was great and accessible in the center of LA. The neighborhood was very urban with the usual parking restrictions, but there is still doable street parking if you are willing to walk a short distance. We found a great variety of unique restaurants within walking distance with a full service grocery just a few blocks away. I would recommend this listing without hesitation to my friends and definitely would stay again.

Apartment is next to the elevator so you can hear it every time someone uses it, and it can be loud as people tend to slam the door shut. The apartment is on the 6th floor so if the elevator isn't working, as it stopped working for us, you'll have to take the stairs up. The last night we stayed, the elevator was broken so people were slamming it really hard and it was very loud. It had upset one of the residents became verbally angry and aggressive as he stomped up and down the hall, shouting at all the residents.  We met with Garth, the host, he was very kind and even though there was an inspection of the apartment he was very nice about letting us know. However, it was a little awkward.

The kitchen had a full size refrigerator which was nice if buying groceries. The apartment stays nice and cool with the window unit AC. The bathroom is a great size and water pressure/heat is wonderful. The queen size bed is really comfortable. The fan above the bed helps keep you nice and cool but has a mind of its own at times. The light would turn on and off on its own in the middle of the night, but I only noticed when staying up late in the evening. The elevator is right next to the apartment and you can hear it throughout the day. At night the elevator doesn't get used much so it's not bad. The parking situation isn't the best as it is really hard to find parking on the block anytime after 5pm. The nice part about the location is that it is close to a lot of things so you can either walk or uber to your destination without having to move your car and loose your parking spot. Other then that, Michael is a good host and responded quickly if I had any issues or questions.

I think this was because the property and living situation wasn’t accurately described on the Airbnb website.      This is a high activity/party house. There is a hookah lounge at the front of the house by the living room and the “private courtyard” is used by quite a few guests for drinking, smoking cigarettes/marijuana, music, hanging out etc. The private entrance into the bamboo room leads directly to this courtyard, so it can be noisy in the room.     The bamboo room is located at the back of the main house and is one of 6 rooms on the property. It shares the private courtyard with two other rentals, one that is semi-attached to the main house and the other is free-standing. All entries are within ~ 2 meters of each other, so fairly close together. These rentals were high occupancy, for example during my stay one of the units regularly had 5+ guests and there was also high turnover.     The main house has an additional 3 guest rooms. These rooms share a single bathroom that is located off of the same hallway with the second entrance into the bamboo room. These 3 rooms were also high occupancy and high turnover; during my stay individual rooms would have 3+ guests. This meant there was a lot of people traffic in the hallway with so many guests sharing the same bathroom.     I found the kitchen to be generally messy. There were always dirty dishes in the sink area and little room for food in the refrigerator. I was able to keep some milk and a few small items, but I was never able to cook due to lack of space, the general dearth of pots/pans, cooking utensils, and cleanliness problems.      Parking was also a logistic problem. I ended up getting blocked in by other cars several times and had to wait up to an hour to get out. The only way to resolve the problem was to notify Josh of my schedule the night before and give him access to my car keys so he could essentially valet cars around the property. Often my car was left on the street.    Personally, I didn’t want to live at a party house - there were parties every week, during the week, and on weekends. I felt that Josh expected guests to go along with whatever events were organized. Anytime I brought up concerns, I was treated like there was something wrong with me - I'm sensitive, stressed, etc... For example, one of the other longer term tenants would regularly practice playing drums (full size rock and roll drum set) and Josh told me I was sensitive/under stress (i.e., unreasonable) for not being ok with that. (My cat practically went bald the poor thing was so stressed). There was never any acknowledgement on Josh's side that the problem might be his misrepresentation of the property.     I was happy to leave.

We found it very convenient being both centrally located as well as near the freeways and other major roads. We even split up our rental car and took Uber from place to place and it was more than convenient. Not that we wanted to leave though! Mariano has set up the most generous digs we've ever come across on Airbnb. The basket of snacks (both healthy and not, choose your poison) and a welcoming bottle of wine are merely the beginning. The lush robes, gorgeous beds and delicious coffee provided gave our rushed mornings a sense of luxury. The fantastic garden was a real treat to start the day as well as come back to as well. I used it both for conducting business on my laptop, wifi is great here, as well as the chill zone it's obviously designed to be. This has fast become out home away from home and we shall be sure to be back countless times to LA this year.
