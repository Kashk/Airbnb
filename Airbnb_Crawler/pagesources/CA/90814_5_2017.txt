Great walking distance! Great location with a wine bar across the street and a bar in the basement of the building. The place is small which was perfect for us since we only needed a place to sleep. In total, we were a group of 3 and I think anything bigger might be too much.   The only thing that may be a problem is parking. We had to park down the street in the non-metered street parking.

The only complaints I have was that I left the bedroom window open when I went to bed, and I woke up with a lot of mosquito bites even though the window had a screen. Also, every night and morning, you will hear screechy, weird sounds which is kinda annoying and loud.  I found out it's from all the parrots.

The house is located about 10 minutes walk to the beach pathway and the neighbourhood is perfect for walking or cycling around the interesting houses and beautiful gardens. The house is secluded and private and the outdoor sitting area is in the middle of a jungle garden. Very peaceful and relaxing.  The location is great for walking to unique restaurants, bars, shops, and a well stocked grocery store.  The area is safe and is situated halfway between the downtown area of Long Beach and Belmont Shores both which have many dining and shopping options. Other nearby attractions include whale watching excursions, the Aquarium of the Pacific, Catalina Express, and the Queen Mary. The house looks recently updated with two bedrooms, one with a bunk bed, and one bathroom with a nice shower.  The home is very clean and is well stocked for easy living.  Stephanie was very responsive and took great care in making sure everything was to our liking. We would definitely like to return if it is not booked up!!","reviewer_image_url":"https://a0.muscache.com/im/pictures/67d65534-5f62-4921-afe9-1efa12761487.jpg?aki_policy=x_medium","created_at":"2017-03-14T00:00:00Z"}],"space":"This is a private cottage on a side alley.
