Los Feliz is where you want to be.  Want to go hiking, horse back riding, golfing, biking, tennis, rollerblading, swimming?  They are all less than a five minute walk from my front door.

But Phil, Clayo and Puck were incredible hosts, the room was great and the three days I spent on Huxley were wonderful. I definitely will stay there again next time I visit my son. Phil and Clayo invited me to go with them on a morning walk up a path through Griffith Park- the house sits right at the bottom of the park and so one has access to all the park has to offer- and showed me incredible views. They also invited my family to an amazing brunch, and went out of their way to make my visit special.  It truly is the best deal in Los Angeles and I cannot imagine anyone who would not be happy here.","reviewer_image_url":"https://a0.muscache.com/im/users/21889233/profile_pic/1416678178/original.jpg?aki_policy=x_medium","created_at":"2015-05-25T00:00:00Z"},{"reviewer_first_name":"Laura","comments":"Phil and Cleo were excellent hosts.

Cool shops, restaurants and interesting people just around the corner. The location looks exactly as on the pictures and you will have everything you need. We enjoyed watching netflix after a long and tiring day. We didnt get to meet rebecca but check in and out was no problem and she was available by text. As Los Angeles is so big you better need a car to see more of the city as public transportation is not as good as in other citys. But thats a general issue in LA. The place was a little bit too noisy for my taste at night, because of a main road right in front of the window side. With ear plugs no problem. All in all i would recommend staying at the green machine for good reasons.","reviewer_image_url":"https://a0.muscache.com/im/users/36324686/profile_pic/1434881580/original.jpg?aki_policy=x_medium","created_at":"2015-09-24T00:00:00Z"},{"reviewer_first_name":"Keely","comments":"Rebecca's apartment was just as it was pictured, immaculate and super cute!

It's part of a vast, hilly, residential area that includes Eagle Rock, Mount Washington, Highland Park, and South Pasadena. If you head northeast, you can wander for hours through the narrow winding streets without hitting a freeway. It's in the process of gentrification, but is still extremely diverse, with lots of authentic Mexican and Salvadoran food. There are some awesome bars (Verdugo Bar and Los Candiles), and one of the best brunch places in L.A. (Lemon Poppy Kitchen). There are several great parks. Elyria Canyon has some short, beautiful hikes. Rio Los Angeles and Glassell Park Recreation center have tennis and basketball courts, an outdoor pool (open year-round), soccer, baseball fields. One of the most beautiful spots in the neighborhood is the L.A. river, which in the section closest to us is still wild. It has truly great bird-watching, a ten mile bike path, and just this year opened for kayaking!  Griffith Park and Elysian park are also just across the river. If you aren't familiar with L.A., the East Side (where we are) has really been blossoming lately, with downtown, Silverlake, Echo Park and Highland Park dominating on the nightlife and foodie fronts.\n","picture_url":"https://a0.muscache.com/im/pictures/74058638/c56f4551_original.jpg?aki_policy=large","property_type":"Yurt","public_address":"Los Angeles, CA, United States","seo_reviews":[{"reviewer_first_name":"Luke","comments":"So surprise you can see a Mongolia yurt in LA.was amazing stay here.shower with sunshine in the morning that was fantastic.everything perfect here.Carrick is very nice.i hope he can come visit my place in Beijing.","reviewer_image_url":"https://a0.muscache.com/im/pictures/0dc96b20-b756-4214-bca6-30ebe9a58f17.jpg?aki_policy=x_medium","created_at":"2016-12-13T00:00:00Z"},{"reviewer_first_name":"Neanna","comments":"Carrick's yurt is quite possibly my most favorite place I've ever stayed with air bnb.

If you usually like to stay at the Marriott, this rustic spot may not be right for you. Once inside, you wouldn't guess that you're only a few miles from Hollywood and Downtown Los Angeles. A yurt is the Mongolian version of a teepee, invented by nomads in the steppes of Central Asia. Unlike the traditional version, this yurt sits on a raised platform with hardwood floors, windows, and modern amenities. The circular room is 16 feet in diameter, and the conical roof has a skylight directly over the bed. The setting is a rural oasis in the middle of the city: the yurt sits on a half-acre lot which it shares with a 1920's farm house (where I live), a little red barn (which is also on Airbnb), and a little mobile chicken coop (where our chicken lives). Sitting by the antique wood-burning stove, you can occasionally hear a train go by. There are several hammocks hung around the yard and a firepit that's great for campfire sing-alongs. Just outside the yurt are some mature fig trees, a lemon tree, an avocado tree, and an orange tree (to name a few). Ten steps across the yard is the outdoor bathroom with a toilet, sink and outdoor shower. You stand on rocks from the LA river beneath a giant \"raincan\" shower head that is big enough for two. Above you are tree branches and the sky. The tankless water heater allows infinitely long hot showers.\n\nPET OWNERS: I love pets (especially dogs)! If you are bringing one, please select \"additional guest\" when you book and do a little extra cleanup afterwards.\n\nPHOTOGRAPHERS: I love having photoshoots in the yurt, but it will be a separate fee. Just ask!","summary":"When a friend is thinking of moving to Los Angeles, people make sure to bring them to my house. The yurt is the most compelling part of the conversion experience.

I've stayed in a lot of airbnb's, this was my best airbnb experience by far. The place is just gorgeous, and everything has been thought of - from a little sewing kit, extra towels, and paper pads for writing notes. It felt like I was staying in a luxury hotel, with loads more space and home comforts. There's even a makeup area!     The whole place is light, uplifting and breezy. The bedroom is huge, with a luxury king sized bed, and a fold out sofa for extra people.    The house is in a quiet and peaceful area in Silver Lake, perfect for focusing on work (as I did) or unwinding after a day out and about. Catch Lyft or Uber to get around or hire a car. I chose to use Lyft Line most of the time as it's very affordable and usually doesn't take longer than a solo Lyft ride.    Aaron's dad, Garrison, and their assistant, Mary, are really lovely and only moments away, so if you need anything, they are there to help.     The place is brand spanking new - I was their first guest in this new property - and everything works a charm.     Don't be put off by the lack of reviews to date, Aaron and his family who take care of the property are Superhosts, and you're assured a top notch experience.

It's part of a vast, hilly, residential area that includes Eagle Rock, Mount Washington, Highland Park, and South Pasadena. If you head northeast, you can wander for hours through the narrow winding streets without hitting a freeway. It's in the process of gentrification, but is still extremely diverse, with lots of authentic Mexican and Salvadoran food. There are some awesome bars (Verdugo Bar and Los Candiles), and one of the best brunch places in L.A. (Lemon Poppy Kitchen). There are several great parks. Elyria Canyon has some short, beautiful hikes. Rio Los Angeles and Glassell Park Recreation center have tennis and basketball courts, an outdoor pool (open year-round), soccer, baseball fields. One of the most beautiful spots in the neighborhood is the L.A. river, which in the section closest to us is still wild. It has truly great bird-watching, a ten mile bike path, and just this year opened for kayaking!  Griffith Park and Elysian park are also just across the river. If you aren't familiar with L.A., the East Side (where we are) has really been blossoming lately, with downtown, Silverlake, Echo Park and Highland Park dominating on the nightlife and foodie fronts.\n","picture_url":"https://a0.muscache.com/im/pictures/74058638/c56f4551_original.jpg?aki_policy=large","property_type":"Yurt","public_address":"Los Angeles, CA, United States","seo_reviews":[{"reviewer_first_name":"Luke","comments":"So surprise you can see a Mongolia yurt in LA.was amazing stay here.shower with sunshine in the morning that was fantastic.everything perfect here.Carrick is very nice.i hope he can come visit my place in Beijing.","reviewer_image_url":"https://a0.muscache.com/im/pictures/0dc96b20-b756-4214-bca6-30ebe9a58f17.jpg?aki_policy=x_medium","created_at":"2016-12-13T00:00:00Z"},{"reviewer_first_name":"Neanna","comments":"Carrick's yurt is quite possibly my most favorite place I've ever stayed with air bnb.

If you usually like to stay at the Marriott, this rustic spot may not be right for you. Once inside, you wouldn't guess that you're only a few miles from Hollywood and Downtown Los Angeles. A yurt is the Mongolian version of a teepee, invented by nomads in the steppes of Central Asia. Unlike the traditional version, this yurt sits on a raised platform with hardwood floors, windows, and modern amenities. The circular room is 16 feet in diameter, and the conical roof has a skylight directly over the bed. The setting is a rural oasis in the middle of the city: the yurt sits on a half-acre lot which it shares with a 1920's farm house (where I live), a little red barn (which is also on Airbnb), and a little mobile chicken coop (where our chicken lives). Sitting by the antique wood-burning stove, you can occasionally hear a train go by. There are several hammocks hung around the yard and a firepit that's great for campfire sing-alongs. Just outside the yurt are some mature fig trees, a lemon tree, an avocado tree, and an orange tree (to name a few). Ten steps across the yard is the outdoor bathroom with a toilet, sink and outdoor shower. You stand on rocks from the LA river beneath a giant \"raincan\" shower head that is big enough for two. Above you are tree branches and the sky. The tankless water heater allows infinitely long hot showers.\n\nPET OWNERS: I love pets (especially dogs)! If you are bringing one, please select \"additional guest\" when you book and do a little extra cleanup afterwards.\n\nPHOTOGRAPHERS: I love having photoshoots in the yurt, but it will be a separate fee. Just ask!","summary":"When a friend is thinking of moving to Los Angeles, people make sure to bring them to my house. The yurt is the most compelling part of the conversion experience.

The fate's collided to bring us the most perfect host we could have asked for. Mike took care of my parents as if they were his own, truly. He tried to accommodate their every request and need with humor, kindness and patience. I was so relived that my elderly parents were in the care of someone so thoughtful and professional. If they needed an extra cot, if the floor lamp wasn't working, Mike was there within hours to take care of things. I cannot thank him enough for taking such good care of them during such a difficult transitional period in my parents' life.     As for the apartment, it is exactly as it appears in the photos - in fact it is more charming. I was surprised with all the amenities that came with the unit, from towels and sheets to laundry detergent, fully stocked kitchen, to basic pantry items and toiletries -- you name it, you need it, it was there for your convenience. A lot of thought has gone into making sure the guest can fit right at home right off the bat. There is even a parking garage in the back with a secure gate.  The unit is on a small quiet street in a very safe and family-oriented neighborhood. There are many shops and supermarkets within walking distance, the Glendale downtown business area which includes the Galleria Mall and the Americana is a quick 10 minute drive, and the 134 Freeway is easily accessible .  I highly recommend the apartment and the host, Mike, with the utmost enthusiasm and confidence.

Finding the humor in life and lots of laughing.\" -David    These words rang true to me when I inquired about David's cozy studio apartment. Unfortunately, he does not practice what he preaches.     I've been an active member of Airbnb for years, and hold a spotless record. This was David’s first go.     What I thought would be a mutually beneficial arrangement, progressively became a nightmare. Think twice before renting from David, for your own safety and peace of mind.     I was living/working in Paris when I was offered an exciting job in Los Angeles. On short notice, I uprooted my life and moved, after solidifying a long-term arrangement with David. The plan was for me to stay through December. Too good to be true, apparently.    Upon arrival and after minimal email inquiries, it became clear that he was looking for a way out. He accomplished his mission through a loophole - no overnight guests, zero exceptions.     David does NOT allow a parent, sibling, friend, spouse, or significant other to visit the space - PERIOD. Such action, as I was shocked to discover, is punishable by IMMEDIATE eviction. Special circumstances (i.e. death of a loved one), are not considered. This man will show NO mercy, and I can only describe his behavior as heartless and sad.     After a traumatic occurrence, I emailed him and requested a new door code. He neglected my plea which expressed that I felt unsafe, and simply replied that \"nobody else knows the code\". Impossible.     My opinion is that David's behavior was foul and unwarranted. When we agreed to discontinue direct communication and handle the situation through an Airbnb representative, I was treated with respect and empathy. I was informed, through the representative (who was spectacular, by the way), that David wanted me out the day he found out my boyfriend was visiting from NYC (mind you, the description says he allows couples). The rep secured me four days, acknowledging the situation to be an unfortunate one, given the circumstances.    David lives in NYC and the unit is accessed by a keypad combination, rather than lock and key. An unfortunate (break in) incident led me to realize that the code was shared, David had little to no regard for my safety and privacy. After asking for a new code that he and I would share, my request was met with complete indifference.     In a last ditch effort, David attempted to extort a good review from me, in exchange for two extra weeks in his unit. I declined.     Within 24 hours, David effectively terminated my tenancy because my boyfriend came to visit from New York. What transpired afterwards led to a harrowing few days during which I was forced to find a new home.     David has withheld my mail since, and informed me that it is \"no longer his responsibility\".    I wouldn't with this experience upon my worst enemy (if I even had one).

Discrimination prevents hosts, guests, and their families from feeling included and welcomed, and we have no tolerance for it. Building an Airbnb where everyone can belong hinges on knowing that everyone in our community understands this mission and agrees to help us achieve it.&quot;,&quot;community_commitment.what_happens_to_my_future_reservations_if_I_decline?&quot;:&quot;What happens to my future reservations if I decline?&quot;,&quot;community_commitment.your_future_reservations_will_be_canceled_if_you_decline&quot;:&quot;Any future reservations will be canceled.&quot;,&quot;community_commitment.your_reservation_will_be_refunded_according_to_policy&quot;:&quot;Your reservation will be refunded according to the host’s cancellation policy.&quot;,&quot;shared.learn_more_sentence_link&quot;:&quot;%{link_start}Learn more%{link_end}.&quot;,&quot;community_commitment.future_reservations_will_be_canceled_with_guest_refunds&quot;:&quot;Any future reservations will be canceled and your guests will receive a full refund.&quot;,&quot;community_commitment.if_booked_as_a_guest_future_reservations_will_be_canceled&quot;:&quot;If you booked as a guest, any future reservations will be canceled.&quot;,&quot;community_commitment.what_if_laws_restrict_hosting_certain_guests?&quot;:&quot;What if laws in my area restrict me from hosting certain guests?&quot;,&quot;community_commitment.please_post_legal_restrictions_on_your_listing&quot;:&quot;Please post about the restriction on your listing, but be clear that it is a legal requirement in your area and that you are complying with local law.&quot;,&quot;community_commitment.what_if_i_have_safety_concerns_as_a_host?&quot;:&quot;As a host, what if I have safety concerns about accepting reservations from anyone?&quot;,&quot;community_commitment.if_you_host_shared_space_you_can_restrict_to_same_gender_guests&quot;:&quot;If you will share your living spaces with a guest, you may make a unit available only to guests of your own gender.&quot;,&quot;community_commitment.you_may_turn_down_guests_for_non_discriminatory_reasons&quot;:&quot;Under this policy, you may also turn down a guest for other reasons, just not on the basis of race, religion, national origin, ethnicity, sexual orientation, or age.&quot;,&quot;community_commitment.reflect_on_reasoning_to_avoid_bias_when_considering_requests&quot;:&quot;In general, when considering a booking request, reflect on your reasoning to ensure that bias isn’t a factor.&quot;,&quot;community_commitment.can_i_decline_reservations_requests_from_disabled_guests&quot;:&quot;Can I decline guests with disabilities if I don’t think my home is suitable for them?&quot;,&quot;community_commitment.tell_prospective_guests_about_your_listing_accessibility&quot;:&quot;In many cases, Airbnb hosts are not required to make their homes compliant with the standards set out in the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) .
