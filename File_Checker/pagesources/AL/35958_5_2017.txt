Neal was quick to communicate and return messages. Checking in and out was simple (we checked in late at night, not a problem). Coffee and some granola bars were thoughtfully provided in the room.   Since it is only $35, you will be walking across a working garage to get to the bathroom, which is a work-in-progress auto garage bathroom, but the toilet and shower are clean!   There are many pets on the property, including the horse that met us at the gate upon arrival, and the many dogs that ushered us out (including one cute little puppy that tried to climb into my car and come home with me).   We were just looking for a place to crash, shower, and hit the road again, and this fit the bill. I wish we'd had the chance to check out the property!

When you pull up to this expanse of land housing an old school house, auto shop, a horse, injured dogs, and a plethora of unique individuals, you will feel perfectly safe surrounded by a barbed wire fence with a single gate to get in and out, which doubles as a way to keep the horse, or anything else, inside. You will most likely be greeted by a pack of limping dogs as well as any number of residents. When you go into the auto shop you are welcomed by a ‘do not enter’ sign and walk into a refreshing garage, perfect for those hot days, there are enough tools around the shop to be used as toys, weapons, or killing any eight legged pests you may come across. The auto shop rooms are as described, there is one queen size bed as well as a large couch and two loft beds. The couch I’m assuming is a new design that was created so that every time you sit down on it a dust-like powder rises from the couch, adding to the ambiance of the room. The bathroom is made easy to use since there is no heavy door in the way that you have to pry open and close to get to the room with the shower.    On the property you can relax by the tranquil bathtub of koi fish, or hang out in the kitchen and use its single box of spices, although if you use the kitchen appliances the pots and pans on their own will most likely add flavor to the food. While exploring the area you may be lucky enough to find a noose, several burn piles, and maybe even ‘stubs’ the friendly cat with no tail. The roof is even available to climb onto, there is a ladder leaning against the building, to find it look for the handy grave marker, the roof provides a great view of the property! When back in your room there is even a nifty way to know when it is time to pack up and leave! When the single light goes out and won’t turn back on, you know the time has come, but don’t worry it will turn back on as you start packing up your car! It’s just the property’s way of telling you when it is time to go! Unfortunately we only got to stay for 2 hours until the light decided it was our time to go, but I would definitely recommend the auto shop at Amy’s if you are looking for a stay with a special ‘ominous’ feel.

Definitely read through the reviews if you've never stayed here before. The place is just like the description and how several other reviews describe it. Think of it like camping with shelter, however the bedroom was nicer than expected. Very cozy bed and there's a lamp in the other room you can use if you're not a fan of fluorescent lighting. The bathroom/shower is on the other side of the auto shop garage and it's connected to a permanent resident's room however, you can lock the bathroom and shower area while you're in there. If you're only in town for a couple of days and would rather spend money on cool things to do during the day/night and just need a place to crash (would rather save money on lodging), it's a decent place for sure. The dogs were sweet (we also didn't bring any other pets with us.) Location is great because it's pretty close to a lot of cool nature areas while not being too far from downtown Chattanooga. Amy was very hospitable and gave us a tour of the place upon arrival and was there if we ever needed anything. Interesting history of the schoolhouse! They could def make a business in doing a haunted house/haunted prom theme for Halloween if they wanted to. The bathroom in the school apparently didn't flush and some plumbing was being fixed, but we weren't staying in that part so it was fine. If you're adventurous and would like a cheap, unique, interesting/quirky place to crash for a few days, def check this place out!
