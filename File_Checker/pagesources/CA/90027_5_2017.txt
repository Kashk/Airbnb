Los Feliz brushes up against the 5 freeway, across which you'll find its still under-the-radar neighbor Atwater Village. Ever-trendy Silver Lake sits to the south, with Thai Town and Hollywood to the west. But it's Los Feliz's northern neighbor, Griffith Park, that bestows the neighborhood with its cozy, evergreen-lined hillside and sometimes rustic charm.\n\nWhether you're catching a matinee at a beloved single-screen movie theater, embarking on a house tour of a Frank Lloyd Wright masterpiece or winding down at one of the city's best outdoor dining spots, you'll find plenty to love about Los Feliz.","picture_url":"https://a0.muscache.com/im/pictures/5e7f0f57-78ce-4990-b2fb-72379b2f001e.jpg?aki_policy=large","property_type":"Guesthouse","public_address":"Los Angeles, CA, United States","seo_reviews":[],"space":"Chill explore create enjoy it doesn't get any better than here","summary":"Perfect for diserning travelers artist and explorers who value the finer things in life.  the cottage has been fully renovated and decorated using restoration hardware and other luxury brands\nOur estate is close to Everything and the guesthouse is good for couples, solo adventurers, business travelers, families (with kids), and furry friends (pets)."},"pricing_quote":{"can_instant_book":true,"monthly_price_factor":0.62,"price":{"total":{"amount":4056,"amount_formatted":"$4056","is_micros_accuracy":null,"currency":"USD"}},"rate":{"amount":4056,"amount_formatted":"$4056","is_micros_accuracy":null,"currency":"USD"},"rate_type":"monthly","rate_with_service_fee":{"amount":4056,"amount_formatted":"$4056","is_micros_accuracy":null,"currency":"USD"},"weekly_price_factor":0.8},"recommendation_reason":null},{"listing":{"beds":1,"extra_host_languages":[],"id":1046292,"is_business_travel_ready":false,"is_family_preferred":false,"is_new_listing":false,"is_superhost":true,"lat":34.11609177110436,"lng":-118.27307538143205,"localized_city":"Los Angeles","name":"private sanctuary with Breakfast","person_capacity":2,"picture_count":32,"picture_urls":["https://a0.muscache.com/im/pictures/48952688/58889879_original.jpg?aki_policy=large","https://a0.muscache.com/im/pictures/15730358/51372e42_original.jpg?aki_policy=large","https://a0.muscache.com/im/pictures/15730059/6276c4ea_original.jpg?aki_policy=large","https://a0.muscache.com/im/pictures/48952787/5acb6d50_original.jpg?aki_policy=large","https://a0.muscache.com/im/pictures/15730158/845f3bdb_original.jpg?aki_policy=large","https://a0.muscache.com/im/pictures/15730168/3d1aae30_original.jpg?aki_policy=large","https://a0.muscache.com/im/pictures/15730180/524a4fc1_original.jpg?aki_policy=large","https://a0.muscache.com/im/pictures/15730198/28f10a4d_original.jpg?aki_policy=large","https://a0.muscache.com/im/pictures/15730213/304826d4_original.jpg?aki_policy=large","https://a0.muscache.com/im/pictures/15730347/743014b0_original.jpg?aki_policy=large","https://a0.muscache.com/im/pictures/15730339/89f1e0c0_original.jpg?aki_policy=large","https://a0.muscache.com/im/pictures/15730240/7a3f3641_original.jpg?aki_policy=large","https://a0.muscache.com/im/pictures/15730287/94c481dc_original.jpg?aki_policy=large","https://a0.muscache.com/im/pictures/15730310/1f0b611a_original.jpg?aki_policy=large","https://a0.muscache.com/im/pictures/48952956/d04a0a33_original.jpg?aki_policy=large","https://a0.muscache.com/im/pictures/48953097/f38361f2_original.jpg?aki_policy=large","https://a0.muscache.com/im/pictures/48953250/2df519ae_original.jpg?aki_policy=large","https://a0.muscache.com/im/pictures/48953394/3d62db36_original.jpg?aki_policy=large","https://a0.muscache.com/im/pictures/15730320/fda4f761_original.jpg?aki_policy=large","https://a0.muscache.com/im/pictures/15730271/2b68a58b_original.jpg?aki_policy=large","https://a0.muscache.com/im/pictures/48951864/a2082ead_original.jpg?aki_policy=large","https://a0.muscache.com/im/pictures/48953666/57dd7ac2_original.jpg?aki_policy=large","https://a0.muscache.com/im/pictures/48952853/3837742d_original.jpg?aki_policy=large","https://a0.muscache.com/im/pictures/48953528/71e34f95_original.jpg?aki_policy=large","https://a0.muscache.com/im/pictures/15941586/db96326b_original.jpg?aki_policy=large","https://a0.muscache.com/im/pictures/15730128/ba42d6fb_original.jpg?aki_policy=large","https://a0.muscache.com/im/pictures/15730095/73958f1e_original.jpg?aki_policy=large","https://a0.muscache.com/im/pictures/15730141/9405ce85_original.jpg?aki_policy=large","https://a0.muscache.com/im/pictures/17f0a6dc-5d7d-460f-add1-c4b893a5f792.jpg?aki_policy=large","https://a0.muscache.com/im/pictures/9c85aabb-a5c2-4669-9295-c93b8dddb1b7.jpg?aki_policy=large","https://a0.muscache.com/im/pictures/b2737182-81a2-481f-a9e0-93d8a1855104.jpg?aki_policy=large","https://a0.muscache.com/im/pictures/aacf3ee2-cef7-4c02-a00a-fdda963eed88.jpg?aki_policy=large"],"reviews_count":63,"room_type":"Private room","star_rating":5.0,"neighborhood_overview":"Los Feliz is one of the most amazing neighborhoods in Los Angeles.

In fact it was nice to have people around to talk with etc. They have a great set up, with some basic food and drinks available, which is great b/c you don't need to worry about the basics when you arrive. I happened to be there in a heat wave so the pool was great to have. the rooms are private, clean,  and have everything you need. Its a great place and fantastic value.

Towels and bed linens are provided and the host offered to replace with clean ones a few times (there is also a big coinop laundry 0.4 miles away that is very convenient and never crowded).

The hosts were easy to coordinate with, and were really responsive to our questions. A lot of great restaurants nearby, like Little Doms (the mushroom Benedict was great). A few things to note:  -bring an eye mask, since there's a lot of light in the early mornings - be mindful if you're a tall person, since the walls slope inwards at dramatic angles (especially in the bathroom), which can make it hard to get around.  - the space is small, so it's a great place for resting when you're not enjoying he city.

painfully cool. It's a polished, albeit still eclectic, neighborhood whose laid-back charms are best explored on foot.\n\nYou'll find most of the shops, bars and restaurants along Hillhurst Avenue, with another cluster of pedestrian-friendly activity on Vermont Avenue, south of Franklin Avenue. Los Feliz brushes up against the 5 freeway, across which you'll find its still under-the-radar neighbor Atwater Village. Ever-trendy Silver Lake sits to the south, with Thai Town and Hollywood to the west. But it's Los Feliz's northern neighbor, Griffith Park, that bestows the neighborhood with its cozy, evergreen-lined hillside and sometimes rustic charm.\n\nWhether you're catching a matinee at a beloved single-screen movie theater, embarking on a house tour of a Frank Lloyd Wright masterpiece or winding down at one of the city's best outdoor dining spots, you'll find plenty to love about Los Feliz.","picture_url":"https://a0.muscache.com/im/pictures/5e7f0f57-78ce-4990-b2fb-72379b2f001e.jpg?aki_policy=large","property_type":"Guesthouse","public_address":"Los Angeles, CA, United States","seo_reviews":[],"space":"Chill explore create enjoy it doesn't get any better than here","summary":"Perfect for diserning travelers artist and explorers who value the finer things in life.  the cottage has been fully renovated and decorated using restoration hardware and other luxury brands\nOur estate is close to Everything and the guesthouse is good for couples, solo adventurers, business travelers, families (with kids), and furry friends (pets)."},"pricing_quote":{"can_instant_book":true,"monthly_price_factor":0.62,"price":{"total":{"amount":4056,"amount_formatted":"$4056","is_micros_accuracy":null,"currency":"USD"}},"rate":{"amount":4056,"amount_formatted":"$4056","is_micros_accuracy":null,"currency":"USD"},"rate_type":"monthly","rate_with_service_fee":{"amount":4056,"amount_formatted":"$4056","is_micros_accuracy":null,"currency":"USD"},"weekly_price_factor":0.8},"recommendation_reason":null},{"listing":{"beds":1,"extra_host_languages":[],"id":1046292,"is_business_travel_ready":false,"is_family_preferred":false,"is_new_listing":false,"is_superhost":true,"lat":34.11609177110436,"lng":-118.27307538143205,"localized_city":"Los Angeles","name":"private sanctuary with Breakfast","person_capacity":2,"picture_count":32,"picture_urls":["https://a0.muscache.com/im/pictures/48952688/58889879_original.jpg?aki_policy=large","https://a0.muscache.com/im/pictures/15730358/51372e42_original.jpg?aki_policy=large","https://a0.muscache.com/im/pictures/15730059/6276c4ea_original.jpg?aki_policy=large","https://a0.muscache.com/im/pictures/48952787/5acb6d50_original.jpg?aki_policy=large","https://a0.muscache.com/im/pictures/15730158/845f3bdb_original.jpg?aki_policy=large","https://a0.muscache.com/im/pictures/15730168/3d1aae30_original.jpg?aki_policy=large","https://a0.muscache.com/im/pictures/15730180/524a4fc1_original.jpg?aki_policy=large","https://a0.muscache.com/im/pictures/15730198/28f10a4d_original.jpg?aki_policy=large","https://a0.muscache.com/im/pictures/15730213/304826d4_original.jpg?aki_policy=large","https://a0.muscache.com/im/pictures/15730347/743014b0_original.jpg?aki_policy=large","https://a0.muscache.com/im/pictures/15730339/89f1e0c0_original.jpg?aki_policy=large","https://a0.muscache.com/im/pictures/15730240/7a3f3641_original.jpg?aki_policy=large","https://a0.muscache.com/im/pictures/15730287/94c481dc_original.jpg?aki_policy=large","https://a0.muscache.com/im/pictures/15730310/1f0b611a_original.jpg?aki_policy=large","https://a0.muscache.com/im/pictures/48952956/d04a0a33_original.jpg?aki_policy=large","https://a0.muscache.com/im/pictures/48953097/f38361f2_original.jpg?aki_policy=large","https://a0.muscache.com/im/pictures/48953250/2df519ae_original.jpg?aki_policy=large","https://a0.muscache.com/im/pictures/48953394/3d62db36_original.jpg?aki_policy=large","https://a0.muscache.com/im/pictures/15730320/fda4f761_original.jpg?aki_policy=large","https://a0.muscache.com/im/pictures/15730271/2b68a58b_original.jpg?aki_policy=large","https://a0.muscache.com/im/pictures/48951864/a2082ead_original.jpg?aki_policy=large","https://a0.muscache.com/im/pictures/48953666/57dd7ac2_original.jpg?aki_policy=large","https://a0.muscache.com/im/pictures/48952853/3837742d_original.jpg?aki_policy=large","https://a0.muscache.com/im/pictures/48953528/71e34f95_original.jpg?aki_policy=large","https://a0.muscache.com/im/pictures/15941586/db96326b_original.jpg?aki_policy=large","https://a0.muscache.com/im/pictures/15730128/ba42d6fb_original.jpg?aki_policy=large","https://a0.muscache.com/im/pictures/15730095/73958f1e_original.jpg?aki_policy=large","https://a0.muscache.com/im/pictures/15730141/9405ce85_original.jpg?aki_policy=large","https://a0.muscache.com/im/pictures/17f0a6dc-5d7d-460f-add1-c4b893a5f792.jpg?aki_policy=large","https://a0.muscache.com/im/pictures/9c85aabb-a5c2-4669-9295-c93b8dddb1b7.jpg?aki_policy=large","https://a0.muscache.com/im/pictures/b2737182-81a2-481f-a9e0-93d8a1855104.jpg?aki_policy=large","https://a0.muscache.com/im/pictures/aacf3ee2-cef7-4c02-a00a-fdda963eed88.jpg?aki_policy=large"],"reviews_count":63,"room_type":"Private room","star_rating":5.0,"neighborhood_overview":"Los Feliz is one of the most amazing neighborhoods in Los Angeles.

Parking was very easy -- tons of street parking available. We were only a 15 min drive away from all the restaurants we wanted to go to. From the Airbnb you can walk right into the huge park nearby.

The neighborhood was amazing, very nice, quiet, and safe. The location is really one of the best in the area as it is so convenient to Hollywood attractions, downtown LA, and just a short drive to Universal and north Hollywood/Burbank area.

She was a perfect host.  She even took a lot of time out of her busy life to talk with us about Paris and show us pictures that she took  there.  We are now in Paris and seeing some of the sights that she encouraged us to see.     And her home is one of the nicest airbnb that we've stayed at so far. Sabine is an interior designer, and her great style is  reflected in the décor of her home. Very cool!  And the outdoor area is beautiful and tranquil. The location of her home is also perfect.  In an upscale neighborhood, and close to all the action of L.A.     We enjoyed staying with Sabine so much that we are also staying there after our Paris trip.  I'm looking forward to relaxing in her garden after our very long flight.

Communication was really good. She stayed up waiting until 12am for us to arrive when our flight was delayed. Once we were there she made sure we were comfortable and then let us crash after a long day of airports.    Our room and private bathroom were clean and just as described. She made us feel very welcome and always asked if we needed anything else. Having coffee and tea in the room was a big plus in the mornings. We were gone most of the days but Sabine always said goodbye or good morning and made us feel very welcome in her house. It was always very quiet and peaceful.     The mattress is a memory foam. It took some getting use to the firmness. We had plenty of towels and the bathroom was nice and spacious. There's an empty dresser in the closet which was really handy.     The location is great if you are renting a car and driving. There was always parking in the small driveway in front of her house. Short walk to Beachwood Cafe in the mornings but there's not much else close by that you can walk to. A short drive down Beachwood and you are already close to everything you need.    Her cats are very cuddly and lovely but they will try to get in your room around 5 or 6AM when you are trying to sleep. They did wake me up a couple times occasionally meowing at the door. If you are use to cats doing this then it shouldn't be a problem.     Also, it does get very bright in the mornings because the shade to pull down over the window didn't block out much of the light. If you have trouble sleeping unless it's pitch black, then this could be a problem.     Overall a great AirBnB experience and I would stay here again. Thanks Sabine!

It is nestled along Beachwood Drive from the Hollywood sign to Franklin Avenue. The area was formerly known as “Hollywoodland”, and the iconic Hollywood sign used to bear this name as well.The views from Beachwood Canyon have always been a major attraction. From the canyon, there are gorgeous views of downtown L.A. all the way to the Pacific Ocean. Going north up the canyon along Beachwood Drive is the best place to get a great shot of the Hollywood sign. The easiest access to get within 300 feet of the sign is to go north up Gower Street to north on Beachwood Drive.\n\nBeachwood Canyon is the epitome of the laidback California lifestyle—tucked high above the hectic pace of city life, the relaxed vibe of the neighborhood seems to come from another era. Many celebrities have been drawn to its unique energy throughout the years, including Madonna, Humphrey Bogart, and Aldous Huxley.\n\nResidents can hike the winding hills, buy their groceries at the local markets, or stop by the nearby cafes. Be sure to check out the Beechwood Cafe, a farm to table eatery with craft beers, located at 2695 North Beachwood Drive ((PHONE NUMBER HIDDEN)) as well as the nearby Beechwood Market 2701 Belden Drive ((PHONE NUMBER HIDDEN)) for groceries and delicious sandwiches.  You can rent horses at Sunset Ranch Hollywood Stables for a ride in the nearby Griffith Park hills. Hikers can climb the six sets of stairs built in the 1920s by Italian stonemasons. Residents of the Beachwood Canyon can also enjoy hiking to Lake Hollywood. The canyons provide ultimate privacy, making the neighborhood seem miles away from civilization. But don’t worry; if you want to explore city life, it’s just a short drive to downtown Los Angeles.\n\nFRANKLIN VILLAGE:\nThis quaint little hipster ‘hood between Hollywood, the 101 and the Hollywood Hills, is an oddity in L.A.—a compact, walkable neighborhood. The Franklin Strip a trendy shopping area with an eclectic mix of restaurants and shops. Birds, Bourgeois Pig, La Poubelle, are some of the oldest (and best) businesses on the Strip. The Upright Citizens Brigade is also located on Franklin Strip and draws plenty of people from outside the neighborhood.","picture_url":"https://a0.muscache.com/im/pictures/22f50fdb-6797-41bd-b400-044ab56c56d2.jpg?aki_policy=large","property_type":"House","public_address":"Los Angeles, CA, United States","seo_reviews":[{"reviewer_first_name":"Bella","comments":"Loved the place...and the neighborhood is great!

Discrimination prevents hosts, guests, and their families from feeling included and welcomed, and we have no tolerance for it. Building an Airbnb where everyone can belong hinges on knowing that everyone in our community understands this mission and agrees to help us achieve it.&quot;,&quot;community_commitment.what_happens_to_my_future_reservations_if_I_decline?&quot;:&quot;What happens to my future reservations if I decline?&quot;,&quot;community_commitment.your_future_reservations_will_be_canceled_if_you_decline&quot;:&quot;Any future reservations will be canceled.&quot;,&quot;community_commitment.your_reservation_will_be_refunded_according_to_policy&quot;:&quot;Your reservation will be refunded according to the host’s cancellation policy.&quot;,&quot;shared.learn_more_sentence_link&quot;:&quot;%{link_start}Learn more%{link_end}.&quot;,&quot;community_commitment.future_reservations_will_be_canceled_with_guest_refunds&quot;:&quot;Any future reservations will be canceled and your guests will receive a full refund.&quot;,&quot;community_commitment.if_booked_as_a_guest_future_reservations_will_be_canceled&quot;:&quot;If you booked as a guest, any future reservations will be canceled.&quot;,&quot;community_commitment.what_if_laws_restrict_hosting_certain_guests?&quot;:&quot;What if laws in my area restrict me from hosting certain guests?&quot;,&quot;community_commitment.please_post_legal_restrictions_on_your_listing&quot;:&quot;Please post about the restriction on your listing, but be clear that it is a legal requirement in your area and that you are complying with local law.&quot;,&quot;community_commitment.what_if_i_have_safety_concerns_as_a_host?&quot;:&quot;As a host, what if I have safety concerns about accepting reservations from anyone?&quot;,&quot;community_commitment.if_you_host_shared_space_you_can_restrict_to_same_gender_guests&quot;:&quot;If you will share your living spaces with a guest, you may make a unit available only to guests of your own gender.&quot;,&quot;community_commitment.you_may_turn_down_guests_for_non_discriminatory_reasons&quot;:&quot;Under this policy, you may also turn down a guest for other reasons, just not on the basis of race, religion, national origin, ethnicity, sexual orientation, or age.&quot;,&quot;community_commitment.reflect_on_reasoning_to_avoid_bias_when_considering_requests&quot;:&quot;In general, when considering a booking request, reflect on your reasoning to ensure that bias isn’t a factor.&quot;,&quot;community_commitment.can_i_decline_reservations_requests_from_disabled_guests&quot;:&quot;Can I decline guests with disabilities if I don’t think my home is suitable for them?&quot;,&quot;community_commitment.tell_prospective_guests_about_your_listing_accessibility&quot;:&quot;In many cases, Airbnb hosts are not required to make their homes compliant with the standards set out in the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) .
