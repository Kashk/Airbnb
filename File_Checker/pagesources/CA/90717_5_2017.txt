Everything makes you feel like your stay has been well prepared for- from the towels to the soap, shampoos, complete toiletries left for you. Glecy was also very helpful in addressing all my concerns. No wonder Glecy's properties are rated almost 5 stars. Glecy is very welcoming. Booking Glecy's rooms is really value for money. The whole house we stayed in has been recently remodelled, so the property is very new and clean. The drive to LA is not too long. I would say 15minutes tops.. It felt like staying in a hotel, and we able to save money &amp; spend more of our trip on food. Glecy was also very flexible when we wanted to extend/do a late check out.

I want to be clear, I am giving this a thumbs up, and would recommend someone to stay here. That said, this place is great AT THIS PRICE. This was my first airbnb stay at this price point. Towel had stains (was washed, but noticeable stains on it), no light next to bed, the desk was wobbly and ugly (leftover wood and some paint), the shower had mold, the sheets weren't great, the mattress cheap, the chromecast did not work and when I asked Sam for instructions he told me to \"(SENSITIVE CONTENTS HIDDEN) it.\" I did, I could not get it to work.   BUT - for the rate, the place was clean, parking was easy, the neighborhood had AMAZING ethnic food (Soba house around that corner I LOVED) and walking distance to Old Town. Sam is just not the warm and fuzzy host you get when you spend $75+ a night. But I will go back (if Sam accepts me!) and likely use this place form time to time when I travel to Torrance.","reviewer_image_url":"https://a0.muscache.com/im/users/2052264/profile_pic/1348208970/original.jpg?aki_policy=x_medium","created_at":"2016-07-01T00:00:00Z"},{"reviewer_first_name":"Rich","comments":"Sam's description is right on - the location was perfect for me!

You see, my review of the Beautiful Master Suite is dependent on my impressions of AirBnB, and, likewise, my thoughts on AirBnB are limited to my experience at the Beautiful Master Suite.    In my opinion, the most important reason to stay at an AirBnB is the Host. In this specific case, the Catena family (Jodi and Steve and family) is the best reason to recommend the “Beautiful Master Suite” in Torrance, CA.    Sure, price is important. But, the whole pricing structure of AirBnB presupposes that the cost will be a much better value than comparable motels and hotels. Don’t take my word for it; make your own price comparisons. I found the Beautiful Master Suite to be about half the price of a similar commercial room.    And, location is very important. Location isn’t just geographical positioning. It encompasses access, proximity, noise level, and safety. More often than not, access will be easier at a commercial location right on a busy thoroughfare. Proximity is absolutely dependent on where the traveler needs to be. Noise level and safety must be vetted for each locale. For my purposes, access and proximity to my needs were just right at the Beautiful Master Suite. Noise level was far better than any room on a major boulevard. Safety? You would have to be in a gated community to get any safer. This is Torrance, after all!    So, that brings us back to the Catenas -- Jodi, Steve, and family. I can’t imagine a better home to stay in than theirs. Jodi, with her never ending warm smile, Steve with gracious generosity and financial advice, and the kids, with their welcoming patience and endurance, all make a splendid family atmosphere to embrace. They each taught me a little something about family.    Specifics? Sure! How about the functional and free workspace -- complete with computer, internet, scanner/copier and printer! And the exquisite décor with maroon and gold throughout and crown moulding above. Least not, the bed was about as comfy as any I’ve had in the most expensive hotels! Entertainment? How about a DVD collection of HUNDREDS of titles and Netflix at your command! Breakfast? You’ll think you were in Hawaii with the abundance of wonderful fruit! Grapes, papaya, mangos, bananas, apples, and more and more!    Is the Beautiful Master Suite perfect?…well, no, but in retrospect, any shortcoming there I would also be find in my own home. I shall not cast stones!","reviewer_image_url":"https://a0.muscache.com/im/pictures/e9608047-e7aa-4d6b-b2f4-8c5a31a25108.jpg?aki_policy=x_medium","created_at":"2016-06-23T00:00:00Z"},{"reviewer_first_name":"Avi","comments":"This was my first Airbnb experience, and I think I hit the jackpot. I was here on business. Steve and Jodi were very accommodating on short notice. They are the ideal hosts. I took notes to emulate their behavior whenever I host someone in the future.     Steve and Jodi are trustworthy, genuine, warm, kind, and extremely knowledge hosts - they shared with me some great advice for my retirement accounts. They acted like my parents - they would be sure I would have enough to eat/drink and that I was comfortable. I only wish I could have stayed longer, but this is definitely a highly recommended place to stay.    I could go on and on, but to sum up, 5 stars doesn't even begin to describe this place. Airbnb should allow exceptional listings and hosts like these to have 10 stars.","reviewer_image_url":"https://a0.muscache.com/im/pictures/ed9880bd-5a27-437e-9a47-9c48e2190817.jpg?aki_policy=x_medium","created_at":"2016-08-09T00:00:00Z"},{"reviewer_first_name":"Chloe","comments":"Hosts, Steve and Jodi,  are very nice people and very friendly.

One morning we needed help after I tripped a breaker after I had too many things plugged in and then decided to use my blow dryer.  We called Rashid and he came right away to help us get it all turned back on.  For our trip we were staying for a week and having our own place that included a kitchen and laundry room really made the trip more comfortable.
