Nina was a very gracious host and although we didn't speak much Spanish she was very patient with us and the other members of the family were always around to answer any specific questions we had (in English). This suite is perfect if you have a car but if you are backpacking we recommend catching a bus or a taxi up to this location very conveniently located just a couple steps away on the corner. The breakfast every morning was wonderful and filling: coffee, juice, meat, cheese, veggies, bread and homemade marmalade. Most impressive.","reviewer_image_url":"https://a0.muscache.com/im/users/36207718/profile_pic/1440967772/original.jpg?aki_policy=x_medium","created_at":"2016-02-20T00:00:00Z"},{"reviewer_first_name":"Maxine","comments":"We had a lovely stay here.

The views overlooking Valparaiso are stunning. The room was clean and comfortable. Note it is a little chilly in the winter but there is a space heater in the bedroom. Breakfast each morning was excellent, made even better by the incredible views.   A few things to note. There is a cat that will visit on the third floor, so be aware if you're allergic. The cat was friendly and we didn't have any issues. Also, the location of the house isn't in the main tourist districts. It is easy to access them by walking, bus, or trolley, but be aware that you may want to take a cab home at night. Lastly, the family doesn't speak much English, although we were able to communicate well enough and our Spanish isn't great. Overall, I would recommend this listing as we had a great two days in Valparaiso.

This suite is on the third floor of a restored house that is more than 100 years old and was built with red wood from Oregon and chilean oak at the beginning of the 20th century. It is a family home that include 4 generations and diferent nationalities. \nIn the morning we will bring the breakfast upstairs, so that you can enjoy the views while you get a good start into the day. \nWe are in a residential and quite area 5 minutes from the Naval Museum, the Artillery elevator and the 21st of May boulevard and only 10 minutes away from the historic harbour district with excellant fish restaurants and many bars. To the more touristic centers of Concepcion and Alegre hill it is a 20 minutes walk or 10 minutes with public buses. \nThere are several public transport options a few steps from the door of our house and for people who come in their own car we have a private parking place.\nWe offer walking tours, wine tours and visits to the museum of the chilean poet and Literature Nobel Price winner Pablo Neruda in Isla Negra, as well as excursions to the La Campana national reserve. We also provide maps and local tips and ideas to help you get the most from your stay in this fascinating UNESCO World Heritage City.\nWe expect your visit and will do our best to make you feel like home.","summary":""},"pricing_quote":{"can_instant_book":false,"monthly_price_factor":0.7,"price":{"total":{"amount":1365,"amount_formatted":"$1365","is_micros_accuracy":null,"currency":"USD"}},"rate":{"amount":1365,"amount_formatted":"$1365","is_micros_accuracy":null,"currency":"USD"},"rate_type":"monthly","rate_with_service_fee":{"amount":1365,"amount_formatted":"$1365","is_micros_accuracy":null,"currency":"USD"},"weekly_price_factor":0.85},"recommendation_reason":null},{"listing":{"beds":1,"extra_host_languages":["ar"],"id":1237886,"is_business_travel_ready":false,"is_family_preferred":false,"is_new_listing":false,"is_superhost":false,"lat":-1.2263063877944413,"lng":36.76918981527516,"localized_city":"Nairobi","name":"Hob House","person_capacity":2,"picture_count":10,"picture_urls":["https://a0.muscache.com/im/pictures/110910219/af12c333_original.jpg?aki_policy=large","https://a0.muscache.com/im/pictures/110912431/2866151b_original.jpg?aki_policy=large","https://a0.muscache.com/im/pictures/110911486/a9e0b4cb_original.jpg?aki_policy=large","https://a0.muscache.com/im/pictures/66363968/7665d42a_original.jpg?aki_policy=large","https://a0.muscache.com/im/pictures/110910687/a01ae584_original.jpg?aki_policy=large","https://a0.muscache.com/im/pictures/66228640/ad5e069c_original.jpg?aki_policy=large","https://a0.muscache.com/im/pictures/110912892/80a06655_original.jpg?aki_policy=large","https://a0.muscache.com/im/pictures/110916281/7734d8e7_original.jpg?aki_policy=large","https://a0.muscache.com/im/pictures/66228815/27d1dab0_original.jpg?aki_policy=large","https://a0.muscache.com/im/pictures/8f4a5be3-ddcb-4880-82e5-47c38c7d1149.jpg?aki_policy=large"],"reviews_count":34,"room_type":"Private room","star_rating":5.0,"neighborhood_overview":"Hob house overlooks corn fields and you hear the cock crow at dawn, but we are just 15 minutes from Nairobi city centre....Giving us the best of both worlds that is city and country side!","picture_url":"https://a0.muscache.com/im/pictures/110910219/af12c333_original.jpg?aki_policy=large","property_type":"Bed &amp; Breakfast","public_address":"Nairobi, Nairobi, Kenya","seo_reviews":[{"reviewer_first_name":"Chris","comments":"We stayed for 4 nights as a couple. Hob House is the most wonderfully warm, cosy, peaceful and homely place you could wish to stay in. Peter, Kelly, Lydia, Angeline, Salome, David, and all the staff were incredibly generous, thoughtful, and welcoming. It is a gorgeous home to be in, from the amazing collection of books and beautiful furniture, to the hand made table serviette holders. The house is so calm and quiet -you'll be woken by birds singing and roosters crowing - but is accessible by car to the main Nairobi attractions. We took day trips to the National Park, giraffe sanctuary, elephant orphanage, museums, Karura Forest, and Lake Naivasha, and it was a pleasure to come home each evening, kick our boots off, and relax in our room.    We loved sitting with the other guests at breakfast and dinner too, chatting &amp; swapping stories. Infact we ended up eating at the house every night because the food that Salome prepared was so hearty and delicious. She took such care to prepare vegan meals for us and nothing was too much trouble.  She even sang when she  was cooking:) All the staff infact showed such genuine kindness and hospitality. We arrived with a smile and a positive feeling, and we got it it back tenfold. We felt so looked after during our time at Hob House and were sorry we only stayed 4 nights.

There are chillies and oranges(mandarin maybe, I am not sure), olives and other vegetables and fruits growing right outside the building we lived in. The portion of the villa we stayed in was spacious with a lovely living room with a functioning fire place. GianLuigi had kept cooking essentials like olive oil, pepper, paprika, coffee, sugar, salt etc in the kitchen. That was a great help when we wanted to cook. We were welcome to take fruits from the wonderful garden. There's a bus stop 5 mins mins walk from the villa. That was very convenient.

The house was clean, cosy, comfortable and equipped with all the necessary things (there was even an iPhone/iPod soundstation!).  The kitchen is spacious and clean - which is great  - as the Di Meglio family allows you to pick all the fresh biological fruits and vegetables like home grown tomatoes, oranges, egg plants, basil etc from their own terrain! Great ingredients for a home-made meal! Also, the local supermarkets, cash-machines are just a 5min walk away from the villa.     Expect to enter a oasis of tranquility where you could reload the good ol' batteries!    Gian Luigi himself proved to be a very nice and helpful host.   He showed us around the island, picked us up from the ferry, gave us some pointers on where to sunbath, dine and drink the best cocktails on the island. Also, as a very nice welcome gift he had a nice local bottle of wine and some cold, fresh water waiting for us in the fridge.

This suite is perfect if you have a car but if you are backpacking we recommend catching a bus or a taxi up to this location very conveniently located just a couple steps away on the corner.

The cat was friendly and we didn't have any issues. Also, the location of the house isn't in the main tourist districts. It is easy to access them by walking, bus, or trolley, but be aware that you may want to take a cab home at night.

Hob House is the most wonderfully warm, cosy, peaceful and homely place you could wish to stay in. Peter, Kelly, Lydia, Angeline, Salome, David, and all the staff were incredibly generous, thoughtful, and welcoming. It is a gorgeous home to be in, from the amazing collection of books and beautiful furniture, to the hand made table serviette holders. The house is so calm and quiet -you'll be woken by birds singing and roosters crowing - but is accessible by car to the main Nairobi attractions. We took day trips to the National Park, giraffe sanctuary, elephant orphanage, museums, Karura Forest, and Lake Naivasha, and it was a pleasure to come home each evening, kick our boots off, and relax in our room.    We loved sitting with the other guests at breakfast and dinner too, chatting &amp; swapping stories. Infact we ended up eating at the house every night because the food that Salome prepared was so hearty and delicious. She took such care to prepare vegan meals for us and nothing was too much trouble.  She even sang when she  was cooking:) All the staff infact showed such genuine kindness and hospitality. We arrived with a smile and a positive feeling, and we got it it back tenfold. We felt so looked after during our time at Hob House and were sorry we only stayed 4 nights. If you're visiting Nairobi, Hob House is definitely recommended!","reviewer_image_url":"https://a0.muscache.com/im/pictures/31a77439-05ec-4534-9dc5-8cd53ae8f419.jpg?aki_policy=x_medium","created_at":"2016-10-19T00:00:00Z"},{"reviewer_first_name":"Angie","comments":"Our stay at Hob House was perfect.

It does actually feel like staying with family or close friends, courtesy the warmth that Kelly brings to the place. The house itself is beautiful, immaculately decorated, with great taste and verve, and is comfortable and convenient. The staff is efficient and helpful. Salome is a great cook and very helfpful with anything that you may want. I got clothes ironed, the guy at the gate packed the Masai I had bought for me. Taxi services offered by Humpryies are reliable and reasonably priced. The beds are comfortable, food is delicious, the location albeit a little outside is not tol far away and Westlands is a 10 minute or so drive.

What made the stay perfect was GianLuigi's villa. It's a magnificent villa filled with lush green plants. There are chillies and oranges(mandarin maybe, I am not sure), olives and other vegetables and fruits growing right outside the building we lived in. The portion of the villa we stayed in was spacious with a lovely living room with a functioning fire place. GianLuigi had kept cooking essentials like olive oil, pepper, paprika, coffee, sugar, salt etc in the kitchen. That was a great help when we wanted to cook. We were welcome to take fruits from the wonderful garden. There's a bus stop 5 mins mins walk from the villa. That was very convenient. We took the bus to go visit Castello Aragnese(Do see it if you are visiting Ischia!) and Port.

One of these situations was our one-week stay in the Di Meglio villa in the wonderful island of Ischia.    The house was clean, cosy, comfortable and equipped with all the necessary things (there was even an iPhone/iPod soundstation!).  The kitchen is spacious and clean - which is great  - as the Di Meglio family allows you to pick all the fresh biological fruits and vegetables like home grown tomatoes, oranges, egg plants, basil etc from their own terrain! Great ingredients for a home-made meal! Also, the local supermarkets, cash-machines are just a 5min walk away from the villa.     Expect to enter a oasis of tranquility where you could reload the good ol' batteries!    Gian Luigi himself proved to be a very nice and helpful host.   He showed us around the island, picked us up from the ferry, gave us some pointers on where to sunbath, dine and drink the best cocktails on the island. Also, as a very nice welcome gift he had a nice local bottle of wine and some cold, fresh water waiting for us in the fridge.     Definitely a worthy recommendation, great place to stay with a great value for your money! I'll make sure to return.

As well as this listing, they are renting two other areas in the house, which we didn't know. The house is SO busy.  There are all sorts of weird rules to follow:  The pool can only be used from 9 to 12 and from 4 to 6 and it is only allowed to seat on a specific side of it. You also need to take it in turns with other people renting.  There is no washing machine or kitchen facilities and only one of the double rooms is actually yours. It was a real pain not to be able to use the washing machine!  The wifi is very very bad! (SENSITIVE CONTENTS HIDDEN) or Youtube were impossible to use and even loading a normal webpage was difficult.  The cleaner only works morning so you need to be out by 11am to get your room sorted.  We like air bnb as opposed to hotels for the independence but felt watched the whole time.   The house is far from everything. 30 minutes drive to town and 50 minutes drive to the nice beaches.   Breakfast is only served between 9 and 10 and is inconsistent. It was nice on some days but pretty poor some other days. You are also charged 5 euros extra if you want anything warm.  The only highlight was Roy the dog.   All of this being said. They were friendly and Sardinia is a wonderful place.

Ozan sent detailed instructions for finding the apartment before our arrival, and his friend Nejat met us and kindly ensured that we were set up for a great stay.    When I read other reviews for this listing, I was slightly concerned that we would have a difficult time traveling to the apartment, but it was very easy, and I would highly encourage you to stay here if you want to see places like Ephesus, Şirince, etc.  There is a minibus (#6) that will drop you off and pick you up from outside the apartment that heads to the Otogar in Kuşadası.  We never had to wait for more than five minutes to get the bus.  From the Otogar, you can make another bus connection to anywhere in the area.  It took approximately an hour to reach Ephesus, and it was certainly a welcome relief to return to the apartment at the end of a hot day and immediately jump in the water.

The seaview is a little less than direct but it is still pleasant to sit on the balcony with a beer and a barbecue and watch the sunset over the Agean, although there's one particular tree that could do with being cut down!    The nearby beach is very close but it is also pretty modest. It's narrow but it does have a friendly little cafe.    The apartment is a fair distance from the hustle and bustle of Kusadasi but a lot of people would say that's a good thing.    Overall the location is great for Ephesus, Didyma, the nearby national parks and the plethora of really nice beaches in the area.     We had a rental car during our stay - believe you can hire one downstairs from the apartment, although we rented ours Izmir - and wouldn't have liked to stay here if we didn't have a car because there is not much else in the neighbourhood.","reviewer_image_url":"https://a0.muscache.com/im/users/9529299/profile_pic/1382271001/original.jpg?aki_policy=x_medium","created_at":"2013-10-27T00:00:00Z"},{"reviewer_first_name":"Simge","comments":"This is a truly charming condo that comes w/ a georgous view of the Long Beach.

After a half hour boat ride (if you're lucky like us, you'll encounter a school of dolphins), you are taken to a secluded retreat.  It's quiet, in nature, and absolutely beautiful.     The hill house:  We stayed in the hill house, which was surprisingly well equipped and really bug proof (though of course there are still bugs).  There is an amazing view from the terrace and it had everything we needed.  It is a bit of a walk uphill, but totally reasonable and a good workout ;)    The food: I highly recommend going for the meal plan.  For ten bucks a meal it's great value, and the food was always varied and delicious. You'll enjoy plenty fresh fruit smoothies, coconut water, and tasty, filling food.  Special shout-out the burger we had one night, who knew that one of the best burgers I'd have would be on an island off of Panama?     The caretaker: Lazare was an incredibly accommodating and friendly host.  We really enjoyed his company and really appreciated everything he did to make our stay as great as it was.     Overall, our stay was awesome.  We stayed for 4 nights; we kayaked to dolphin bay one day, and took the floating dock out into the water in the middle of the night on a full moon on another.  On sunday we went to a restaurant across the bay for a long, bloody-mary'd brunch.  There is a diving board going off the reef cabin that proves to be much fun, and the snorkeling in the area is great.      However, the secluded nature of the place and the natural beauty does owe to the fact that is completely rural, so you shouldn't be expecting the comfort of a five star hotel.  That being said, our stay was completely comfortable and we had everything we needed.  Bring some good bug spray, sunscreen of course, and a few bottles of wine. We stayed in Bocas Town for two nights afterwards and totally regretted it because we missed the place and the people there.

My sister and I were reluctant to leave a review because we were taught that if you have nothing nice to say you should not say anything at all.   Now that we have nursed ourselves back to health from the ridiculous amount of chitra bites (take bug spray, calomine lotion and benedryl just in case) we received  while on Isla Cristobal, we can truly relay the positive notes of our trip:    1) Amazing care takers that were always willing to help with anything one might need.  2) Hearing the dolphins in the evening  3)Bio- Luminescent algae and jelly fish right off the dock!!!!  4)  Fresh coconuts right off the property     A Belgian couple has taken over the air bnb business for Ulrich and we were their first guests.  When we arrived in Almirante to meet our transportation we waited 45 minutes for them.  We then had to hike around Almirante for 2 hours (with our luggage)  while our host purchased the finishing touches for the reed cabin that was not even complete when we arrived.  Our first night we spent sharing the hill house with our hosts because the reef cabin still needed work.  They said we could still stay in the cabin that evening but we were so tired that all we wanted to do was shower, eat and sleep. Our last full day in Panama, the reef cabin was still being worked (URL HIDDEN) siesta that afternoon.      We knew that Lazare and Dorien were newbies but we felt that since they had already been on the property two weeks before our arrival that the cabin would have been ready. At first we were very exited to explore  with them but as time went on we realized that they knew very little about the area.      They may offer you a $12 pp rate on daily meals but I wouldn`t accept it.  You are better off getting your own groceries and cooking for yourself.  The hill house kitchen is in a state of constant bug attraction.  Food is left in the sink for way too long and the insects are all over.      Wifi does not work in the reef cabin so if you need to connect, you will have to hike up the hill to the hill house and hang out in a shared area in order to email, (SENSITIVE CONTENTS HIDDEN) or whatever.  The hike is just a few minutes but you will surely feel it in your legs as it is steep!  Bring extra flashlights just in case.    The composting toilet is just a fancy term for outhouse...also another 2-3 minute walk in the mud from the reef cabin.     If either Ricardo or Edgar end up driving the boat for any of your tours they deserve a hefty tip.  There guys go above and beyond to make sure you enjoy your stay.....they are Lazare and Doriens life-line and were by far the high light of our stay.","reviewer_image_url":"https://a0.muscache.com/im/users/4050944/profile_pic/1356021745/original.jpg?aki_policy=x_medium","created_at":"2013-01-05T00:00:00Z"},{"reviewer_first_name":"Nicole","comments":"We had an amazing time at the Jungle Retreat!

My daughter said she loved kayaking across the bay to visit the little village (quaint and picturesque yet Ernesto, the owner of the little store lived in the United States for many years and speaks English.  He's really nice and brought out food for my daughter to feed to the fish that gather around his dock) because it was above the jellyfish and sea urchins and below the wasps and chitres :-)    Kind of true, but  if you want to night snorkel with bioluminescent organisms making trails of light stream off of your hands and feet, paddle board up to wild dolphins, jump out of your second-story window into warm water, snorkel with  rays, nice, healthy coral, lots of juvenile fish and some lovely mangrove root environments, and even  ride a horse (well, briefly, they don't have the saddle yet but it's a pretty, willing little almost-black horse) you have to put up with the invertebrate life.    In actuality, the wasps make a lot of noise but never bothered any of us though my engineer husband liked drinking beer and watching them make their nests.  The sea urchins can actually be held (!) if you're careful though they should be knocked off the stairs each morning before using them to get on and off the dock.  The jellyfish are mostly towards the middle of the bay. We snorkeled in spite of them though we usually wore dive skins so we wouldn't have to worry.  (Diveskins are a great investment. We used them for the last three trips. They protect you from everything… jellyfish, sun, and chitres).  There also geckos and bats but we like those little bug eaters and you sleep under a mosquito net so you don't have to share your space TOO closely.  BTW the main bedroom is quite romantic.    The house itself was much more comfortable and better appointed than I had expected. Lazare and his wife live there when there are no guests and make you feel free to borrow anything you need.   Lots of charming, Swiss family Robinson touches plus all the comforts of home and  some our home doesn't have like a juicer :-) good snorkeling equipment, several kayaks and the paddle board which turned out to be even better than the kayaks, etc.  The only missing comfort was an indoor toilet though you can work around that if you are creative.  There is even a camping water heater for showering though that seemed like too much bother in such a warm climate.    In all, it was a great, once-in-a-lifetime experience and as comfortable as one could expect to be without being sealed in an air-conditioned room!","reviewer_image_url":"https://a0.muscache.com/im/users/5743360/profile_pic/1432308922/original.jpg?aki_policy=x_medium","created_at":"2013-08-15T00:00:00Z"},{"reviewer_first_name":"Evan","comments":"Stayed here for a week for our honeymoon and it was the best decision we had ever made. We stayed at all rooms, house and both cabins, and every room we stayed in was comfortable. For the seven days that we were there, it rained for three days and it was still beautiful! Don't worry about rainy season, it is still a magical place with lots of cover! When it was sunny, we saw lots of pretty coral, different kinds of fish, kayaked, snorkeled, SUP, went fishing(far from cabins), wake boarded (upon request) and went to Zapatillas(A MUST!) and it was all AWESOME! If you get a chance to hike, do it, it's so lush and beautiful with great views! Bring bug spray and sunscreen!   Lazare and Jody were the best hosts we could ever imagine. We instantly felt comfortable as soon as we met them. They were so accommodating, funny, GREAT COOKS, gave us privacy but were awesome company. Have them cook for you! Jody made this awesome garlic soup that I still think about until this day and Lazare with his tasty sauces and smoothies! Mmmm! You guys are the best!   We saw Dolphins almost every day so close to the dock! If you go to Panama, COME HERE!!! Thank you, Lazare and Jody, for making our honeymoon an unforgettable one!

It has its own kitchen and composting toilet and an outdoor shower. \n\nFor separate bookings of the Dreamy Mangrove Treehouse please see:\nhttps://www.airbnb.com/rooms/15160244\n\nThe House up on the hill is made completely with lumber grown on site, and has a 180 degree view of the Tierra Oscura Lagoon.   It has a master bedroom with a king sized bed; a screened-in loft space with 3 queen sized beds, which can be converted into a yoga studio or meeting space, and  a basement dorm with 3 beds. This house has a septic system with a shower and 2 flushing toilets and a full kitchen.  \n\nClean linens and towels are provided for all guests. \n\nMeal services are offered on the dock, but spices, cooking oils, rice, and other kitchen basics are provided for your use, should you want to cook for yourselves, along with fresh young coconut juice, bananas, and other fresh goods from the property. (Cilantro, lemongrass, and citruses all grow around the Hill House!)\n\nTours are also available to neighboring beaches, rivers and towns, pricing varies by the number of guests.  Round trip boat ride will take you to the town of Bocas del Toro, or Old Bank on Bastimentos, which have many bars and restaurants, a fun backpacker party scene, some very good food, some not-so-good food, an airport, several small supermarkets, local fruit and vegetable stands, and lots of local color and diversity. A similar boat trip will take you to the mainland (Almirante), a jumping off point for extended trips to Panama's incredible cloud forest or Costa Rica. We also offer tours to neighboring beaches and National parks, Zapatillas islands, Red Frog Beach and Starfish Beach are the most famous. \n\nBring your bug spray, your hiking boots, and your bathing suit! It's tropical adventure time!\n\n\n!!! IMPORTANT: THIS IS A RUSTIC PLACE, NOT A RESORT !!!  \n\nIt's for the adventurous, who want reasonable comfort in a remote setting, and want to experience realities of rural life in the tropics. In addition to the abundant pleasures of the lush forests and reefs, you should expect to…..\n\nGO OFF GRID: You will run out of running water if you take long showers or if the rains don't come. The solar panels are backed by a generator, but you'll need to remember to turn off lights and fans when not in use — especially when the clouds hang out for a few days. \n\nWEAR BUG PROTECTION: We are bug conscious in the design of our accommodations.  You will see dozens of geckos feeding on the insects on the outside of the screens that keep you nice and relatively bug free in the house. That being said, a layer of coconut oil, or bug spray can keep you comfortable during \"Chitra Hour\" when the no-see-ums come out at dawn and dusk. These critters are generally predictable, so its easy to be prepared.","summary":"We are located where 145acres of Jungle meet a turquoise Lagoon.On the southern tip of remote Isla Cristobal, an island without roads, you are sure to feel submerged in nature.With 5 accommodations lining the waterfront, we encourage visitors to snorkel our half-mile reef.A Jungle Lodge offers a 180 degree view of the Tierra Oscurra Lagoon,a dorm-style room for large groups, and roof-top patio for yoga sessions or business meetings.

Federico is a very nice person, it was a pleasure to be hosted by him. The B&amp;B is well located in the city historic center, close to various touristic sites, restaurants, bars. The apartment is nicely decorated and the room we stayed in is spacious. However, the quality of the bed is poor and the apartment was a bit under heated for this time of the year (January). Breakfast is good but nothing special. Overall, I think the standing of the apartment could have been a bit higher given the price we paid.

My partner and I had a truly amazing experience. Kagan and Bilgi's house is literally set nestled in beautiful lush green mountains.  We arrived at the house late at night, after kagan very kindly picked us up from the local village, where we were dropped off by our taxi from the airport. Kagan and Bilgi showed us around and had also left us some locally sourced food from organic eggs to locally produced honey and drinks in the fridge, which we were pleasantly surprised by!  The house was extremely comfortable, and the view was absolutely spectacular from the terrace! Right down onto the mountains and out into the sea. it really was so special. Not to mention the adorable well kept little garden, and mini pool also!  If you love nature and the outdoors, and need to really unwind, then this is by far the place to be. The only sounds we could hear from the house were sounds of nature. Anything from bee's during the daytime, owls at night, including a couple of dogs from the neighbour's house. Foxes, and a few rustlings from perhaps a wild pig or two, which we would have loved to have witnessed, but they kept themselves well hidden!  We did not have a car, but we managed to walk to the village where we very fortunately met a lovely taxi driver and his lovely family, where we could get around from. The weather was perfect and not too hot! ideal as we stayed there the first week of October. The beaches are beautiful, and if you enjoy doing adventurous long walks as we do, you could even come across the odd secluded beach along the way which was definitely worth the walk once we got there! I don't think I had ever seen a more idyllic setting.  We want to thank Kagan and Bilgi for their hospitality, and couldn't recommend staying at their beautiful home enough!

The home was so much more than we expected, spacious, modern, clean, beautiful, you name it. The jacuzzi on the deck and in the bathroom is a perfect way to unwind after, treking through the mountains or even a relaxing stroll up to Kabak villiage. We even had some wine, beer and breakfast in the home for us, not forgetting the most delicous local honey.   As mentioned already, a 4wd is ideal, however we managed to do it in a nissan micra, but a 'bigger' car is reccomended.  Kağan and Bilgi were the most amazing hosts, offering us home cooked food and Kağan even leant us 100tl after we had run out of Turkish Lira to get a shuttle bus down to the beach to change some more money up.

Half way up a very treacherous drive we had to turn back because the car wasn't up to it.       Despite Kagen's insistence that we needed a 4x4, I wish we had tried the drive it in the modern 2x4 car that we used for rest of our trip - I think we would have been fine.  When we could not make it up to the house, Kagan was responsive to our e-mails, but did not offer us either a refund or a ride.       Judging from the ad, the house is beautiful and getting there is certainly an adventure.  Be prepared for a harrowing drive and make sure you have a vehicle that is up to the task.

It was mythically beautiful, nestled in the valleys. The house is recently developed and has been done to the highest quality - all the more impressive given how difficult it must have been to build to this level in the terrain. \"Going the extra mile\" seems to be the host's way of doing things though and made the holiday truly restful.     The plunge pool in the photo is as excellent as it appears (if not more so) - truly idyllic to watch the sun go down over the valleys in it and a relief in summer when you have spent the day out in the heat.     Getting to the house is not a gentle drive but that made it all the more fun for us - using the recommended hire company for a 4x4 is essential. My view was that if you wanted a house right away from the tourist trail, you couldn't expect a tarmac road right up to the door.     The host was possibly one of the kindest people we've ever met! A real pleasure to interact with as he is so calm, he told us to do a \"proper\" shop in the town before coming to the house which turned out to be very sensible advice. He also drove with us to the house, showing us the way. We really appreciated this as the forest roads can get confusing.    We went for a few runs along the valleys early in the morning and went to Kabak (about 15 minutes drive from the house) and Aktas Beach (1 hour walk, 5 minute drive) both of which have simple, quiet restaurants. Fethiye is 45-60 mins and Ölüdeniz 25-40 mins drive away but fortunately feels like a world away given the heavy tourist presence in both. The fish market at Fethiye was a nice change of pace but we were so happy to return to our mountain hide-away at sunset.     I thoroughly recommend this place to anyone: admittedly, we are an active, sporty couple and enjoyed the walks, runs etc. through the forests alongside the goats and tortoises (!) but you could easily spend a week relaxing in the house alone as the quietude is inspiringly beautiful.","reviewer_image_url":"https://a0.muscache.com/im/pictures/6c3caed2-8a0a-4611-838e-355992865852.jpg?aki_policy=x_medium","created_at":"2015-08-01T00:00:00Z"},{"reviewer_first_name":"David","comments":"A wonderful home with breathtaking views that these photos cannot compete with.

If you need a place to just relax and get away from it all, look no further, you just found it, it is the striped sofa next to the pool.  The house is very comfortable, tastefully decorated, clean and fully equipped.
