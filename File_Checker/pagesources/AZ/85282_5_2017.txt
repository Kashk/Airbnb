While the hostess was very kind (we especially appreciated the fresh oranges and apple pie left for us when we arrived, as well as the list of suggested activities and restaurants), this condo leaves quite a bit to be desired.  It felt like a place that will eventually be a great Airbnb, but at present, is simply in need of too much work:  1.  It is very out-dated-- kitchen appliances and bathrooms are desperately in need of updating.   2.  There are NO curtains on the front windows, yet these look out onto the sidewalk, which is 5 feet from the condo, and across to a public park that was busy well into the night.  While there is a 4' wall between the condo and the sidewalk, one could still see in/out without problem.  It was very uncomfortable to be in the condo at night with the lights on because it was easy to see straight into the living room. 3.  Safety- the patio door (which connects directly to the living room and therefore, into the house) has a door knob and lock that are broken.  It is only secured with two small hook-and-eye locks.  Again, very unnerving to be in the home with a fairly busy park right across the street, especially with such shoddy security. 4.  The condo is not fully stocked with necessary supplies.  For example, there was only ONE knife in the whole place, making it impossible to cook a meal that required cutting.  It could also be helped with more dishes.

This was our fourth trip to Tempe and by far the most comfortable. The kitchen is spacious (we enjoy cooking), the living area great for relaxing, and the lovely art on the walls gives a wonderful personality to the space. It is, in a word, warm. There’s also porch that faces the dramatic Arizona sunrises. There’s close proximity to popular hiking venues, as well as the Park and Ride lot, so you can easily access the light rail system. I’d recommend this to anyone.

I believe in handmade quality products that have not been factory made in China. I pride myself on all the furniture, dishes, and ornate pieces throughout the condo being from all over the world. I also really like how quiet it is here. The medical school I attend is next door with a nice garden area you can see from the patio. You can also see the mountains in the distance at sunrise from the East view off of the balcony.  \nThe condo is on the third floor so Stair climbing Will be a part of the experience :)\n\nDowntown Phoenix is home to numerous sporting venues such as Chase Field and US Airways Center, as well as the Phoenix Art Museum, Arizona Science Center, Heard Museum, and the Children's Museum. Many great restaurants are within a 5 minute walk and we can recommend a few of our favorites for you. The Oak Light Rail station which can take you to Downtown Phoenix, Phoenix Sky Harbor Airport,  and is only 1.5 miles from well known/eclectic Mill Avenue and home to Arizona State University, and Mesa with it's wonderful Mesa Center for the Arts.\n\nDay trips from Tempe/Phoenix include: \nSedona - 2hrs.  \nJerome - 2 hrs.  \nTucson - 2 hrs.\n\nIt's hard to do the Grand Canyon as a day trip and really enjoy your time there. Instead fly into Phoenix and spend 1 or 2 nights here then spend a night in Flagstaff or at canyon itself. 4 1/2 hr drive from Phoenix.","summary":"The condo is near the heart of Tempe &amp; 10 mins. from Old Town*\n-Easy access to the 101\n-Queen size bed, (pillow top)\n-Full kitchen \n-Washer &amp; Dryer\n-Large bath tub (great for a nice hot soak)\n-Hot tub/Pool about 15 yards awy"},"pricing_quote":{"can_instant_book":false,"monthly_price_factor":0.8,"price":{"total":{"amount":2794,"amount_formatted":"$2794","is_micros_accuracy":null,"currency":"USD"}},"rate":{"amount":2794,"amount_formatted":"$2794","is_micros_accuracy":null,"currency":"USD"},"rate_type":"monthly","rate_with_service_fee":{"amount":2794,"amount_formatted":"$2794","is_micros_accuracy":null,"currency":"USD"},"weekly_price_factor":0.95},"recommendation_reason":null},{"listing":{"beds":5,"extra_host_languages":["es"],"id":12807132,"is_business_travel_ready":false,"is_family_preferred":false,"is_new_listing":false,"is_superhost":false,"lat":33.390400135496144,"lng":-111.92400510908821,"localized_city":"Tempe","name":"Tempe Home for Students ONLY","person_capacity":4,"picture_count":15,"picture_urls":["https://a0.muscache.com/im/pictures/64958c56-8912-47fd-be9b-f7e58c3cb529.jpg?aki_policy=large","https://a0.muscache.com/im/pictures/a6bf1c3e-9cd2-4484-9115-cd420a19b31b.jpg?aki_policy=large","https://a0.muscache.com/im/pictures/bd1442d0-6f02-4ac4-9e11-405f631e32dc.jpg?aki_policy=large","https://a0.muscache.com/im/pictures/4ad252d2-4e86-4500-a7a5-766004ba5e0e.jpg?aki_policy=large","https://a0.muscache.com/im/pictures/c676e551-7ad0-462c-88e2-36c77e13b080.jpg?aki_policy=large","https://a0.muscache.com/im/pictures/912509bf-7d6d-418d-a520-a8d0419bdf87.jpg?aki_policy=large","https://a0.muscache.com/im/pictures/4353679d-2219-4ddb-995f-88e8c65fca9b.jpg?aki_policy=large","https://a0.muscache.com/im/pictures/dd7ad397-3cb9-4788-932b-6c913321b80a.jpg?aki_policy=large","https://a0.muscache.com/im/pictures/e5096a42-bb5b-40b3-93f9-01ba2d565a1c.jpg?aki_policy=large","https://a0.muscache.com/im/pictures/49167d13-f953-43a9-8bc3-85949ff8a211.jpg?aki_policy=large","https://a0.muscache.com/im/pictures/115d7499-c618-42c5-b7c7-30cf4b095197.jpg?aki_policy=large","https://a0.muscache.com/im/pictures/44e33c84-9e32-4af0-a937-d0160bbaca1f.jpg?aki_policy=large","https://a0.muscache.com/im/pictures/46b635e9-5444-4392-9075-f3613833f489.jpg?aki_policy=large","https://a0.muscache.com/im/pictures/bf089458-ef99-42ae-b147-cfaf20a3ef66.jpg?aki_policy=large","https://a0.muscache.com/im/pictures/d940fcaf-e580-453e-b02f-2dc07d76fc75.jpg?aki_policy=large"],"reviews_count":4,"room_type":"Private room","star_rating":5.0,"neighborhood_overview":"","picture_url":"https://a0.muscache.com/im/pictures/64958c56-8912-47fd-be9b-f7e58c3cb529.jpg?aki_policy=large","property_type":"House","public_address":"Tempe, AZ, United States","seo_reviews":[{"reviewer_first_name":"Sylvia","comments":"Mariana &amp; Lucian are great hosts. Cleanliness, comfort, respect for privacy, encouragement and concern for welfare are a standard in their home, which is normally shared with university international exchange students. They made an exception by graciously accepting my booking as a nonstudent, and it was a rewarding experience.  The house is spacious, with Wi-Fi working throughout...even outside at the pool. Bedrooms are comfortable and have a desk. The kitchen, living, den, and dining areas are open 24/7 and there are always snacks. The bar is a great alternative place to plug in your laptop, research, study and have a coffee.  The diverse cultural environment (on this occasion, Mexico, Saudi Arabia, West Papua, Romania, Lebanon and the United States) enhanced the overall positive disposition and created a welcoming, educational and just plain pleasant atmosphere.  Dinner (yes included in the package) is a sit down affair, where everyone compares their native vocabulary and practices English by sharing their day's events...successes, challenges, goals, funny stories, politics, and yes, even bad experiences. Around that table, all ends on a positive note of cheers towards the better tomorrow, life and future ahead for everyone...with smiles and much contagious laughter.  Mariana made the large sign at the front door that reads...\"There are no strangers here, just friends you haven't met yet.\" Below the sign are shelves of books, games, trinkets, etc with instructions to \"Give things you do not want. Take things you would like\"  Great stay.
